## Development & Assessment

Make sure python3 is installed.

```bash
# unzip the submitted zip file
cd A0040955E_D3Assignment
python3 -m http.server
open http://localhost:8000/
```

Alternatively, visit https://weilu.github.io/cs5346/A1/ to view the visualizations.

Tested in Chrome and Firefox. Doesn't work on Microsoft Edge.

## Task 1

Draw plots to show the Average quality and number of changes in quality for a method. Each buffer configuration should have separate plot.

- Data is grouped by bufSize and method, then in each group avgQuality and avgChange are results of taking the mean of quality and change fields respectively.
- Bar chart is chosen as it allows quick visual comparison of quantitative data across a set of categories â€“ in this case avgQuality/avgChange of various streaming methods.
- User can choose buffer configuration to display by clicking on the radio button in the legend on the top right corner.
- Similarly, user can choose whether to compare the average quality or average number of changes in quality by clicking on the radio buttons in the legend. It changes the y-axis.
- The global average across method is represented using the dashed line. It allows user to quickly identify which methods perform above/below average.

User can gain insigts throught interactions with the visualization, e.g. Method1 consistently underperforms in term of quality compared to the global average, and it also incurs more changes in quality when the buffer size is low (30/60/120). Though it incurs fewer changes when buffer size is big - 240, the average quality remains lowe. Therefore, we can conclude that Method1 offers low quality in all settings and it may have to do with the frequent changes during streaming.

## Task 2
Draw a single plot to show the Average QoE for a method grouped by different buffer configuration. The plot should be in such a way that we can compare the performance of the method with itself for different buffer configuration as well as with different methods within a buffer configuration.

## Task 3
Draw plots to show the correlation between inefficiency and quality for all methods in different buffer configurations.

## Task 4
We would like to know the methods which have the minimum number of stalls for video V7 under different network profiles. Draw appropriate plot for it.
