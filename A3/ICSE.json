The author's perspective is traced through an early emphasis on development tools and methodology to an emphasis on specifications and requirements to a broader emphasis on overall manageability. The evolving thought process is projected ahead and illustrated by some current efforts and activities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approaches to further enhancing the development process and the author's view on which areas should be given the main attention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803217"],"title":"A Perspective on Software Development","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Various types of software were developed, including real time applications, support, and hardware installation and maintenance. Two million instructions were developed at a cost of approximately five thousand staff years of effort. The objective of this paper is to document the staff resources utilized in this development. The actual development rates for the different types of software and the various factors affecting those rates are analyzed. Software productivity is shown to be a function of the type of software - logical, algorithmic, man machine, etc. Emphasis is placed upon total project productivity. The allocation of staff resources for the systems engineering, design, code and unit test, and integration activities, which had an approximate percentage distribution of 20, 20, 17, 43, is analyzed and characterized.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807693"],"title":"An analysis of the resources used in the SAFEGUARD system software development","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

However, previous studies that investigated the correlation between code coverage and test suite effectiveness have failed to reach a consensus about the nature and strength of the relationship between these test suite characteristics. Moreover, many of the studies were done with small or synthetic programs, making it unclear whether their results generalize to larger programs, and some of the studies did not account for the confounding influence of test suite size. In addition, most of the studies were done with adequate suites, which are are rare in practice, so the results may not generalize to typical test suites. \n We have extended these studies by evaluating the relationship between test suite size, coverage, and effectiveness for large Java programs. Our study is the largest to date in the literature: we generated 31,000 test suites for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. We measured the statement coverage, decision coverage, and modified condition coverage of these suites and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness. \n We found that there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. In addition, we found that stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite. Our results suggest that coverage, while useful for identifying under-tested parts of a program, should not be used as a quality target because it is not a good indicator of test suite

Application development for mobile platforms opens an additional area of qual i ty-power consumption. In PDAs or mobile phones, power consumption varies depending on the hardware resources used, making it possible to specify and validate correct or incorrect executions. Consider an application that downloads a video stream from the network and displays it on the mobile device's display. In the test scenario the viewing of the video is paused at a certain point. If the specification does not allow video prefetching, the user expects the network card activity to stop when video is paused. How can a test engineer check this expectation? Simply running a test suite or even tracing the software execution does not detect the network activity. However, the extraneous network activity can be detected by power measurements and power model application (Figure 1). Tools to find the power inconsistencies and to validate software from the energy point of view are needed.","inCitations":["6ab716a4d09ff601578b04277c8382b6c6f0740d","0d42a3a6c31f005d173fc6851bb02695bb820ad4","79d474d9d0e026aac162f979a4559806cc9bfac9","aa0c0aa667de832921df88ef91b9407020590d52","b14c7b200c258474a19abce9e93b7bae583b101e"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0201028v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0201028v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.SE/0201028","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581460"],"title":"Software validation using power profiles","doi":"10.1145/581339.581460","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581460","venue":"ICSE"}

Control concepts are abstract notions about interactions between control flow, data f70w, and computation, eg. %ead-process loop99. They are recognized by comparing a language independent abstract program representation against standard implementation plans. Recognition is eficient and scalable because the program representation is hierarchically decomposed by propers (single entry/exit control jlow sub-graphs). A recognition experiment using the UNPROG program understander shows the method’s performance, the role of proper decomposition, and playfulness in a sample of programs. As an example of the method’s applications, we describe how recognized control concepts are used to perform Cobol restructuring with quality not possible with existing syntactic methods.","inCitations":["e072bde758c675ead06ccf12daffa3ca22c0a9e6","816d4909989fa628041d519eaafe6a7c66c3e44e","765dc0d8f6c62350352220175a79c5657426a986","de4198e96cae5d7066db3b914f0b0c7fc4d9920a","e6a943d75f0570f6199d3290fa53e00c45835106","2b2c7b4c7b0768ea044a15f7b09d1513026b2992","7fbc4e371668f9cfee7b99baf6d8ddaaa234c49b","08cbdab384308b072e8b298644ea5b084ced40ac","44916279e69cb149c84b0f0618a751ae73707b8a","651416e452cf4160fca8b7042e2957325dd781c1","5442844a31e7d49cece769a942d5370e81e5262d","f88b61c8bd60e3faabbee27a1ee6cc12d6cf93b1","a3b0ff9f2e8425ab013b856c41ffac72faf3873f","d812af5bc2e5a1a9a89f3ed0ff0b91d1f85124ff","a7dd718c19d63512f9f06e424de6190468cd6f43","9f64046d8ae29c485f22a0f8a286aa6b58f9e298","1d2aef1c0757adb9c209dd672d34841182c4e375","c5700c1b259312ade09d9eccc853a4f22fc9ca98","2fb84559d9083cfd3f36883d07bc7fef3650a398","f5b6b39cbf827baacafe5cb55365732ad7465437","0c53687d9215abe39e91d980e459b50a78614d8b","d04a82e7e181a0315f4c7fd6c6d9f7d2fa11054d","cbc5eaf4995813fa1401f5ad932202650b95338a","6caf2ee79a27f0f7dc9b160de07be2db00457331","12819551ec19d7da5f8e6fede36a935c4df26264","d3e756e5c81d6dc5867b93cffd26b09fd78c492a","102aea8581c2ece19c44014ae19b04bb63ad63a6","93968a0adc5a0a2eae732ee47ff3a353db09964b","9d710018767e8740a340fd2a78ef1f767eda919e","ba5aad2ec7564b2cf13080d1ffd14d8ccfe98465"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=256664.256684","http://swunderstanding.com/icse-paper.pdf"],"title":"Understanding Natural Programs Using Proper Decomposition","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Browsers expose semantic and syntactic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relationships are derived using tools which perform static analysis on the original software documents. Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strategies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right browsing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant crossreference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive coding for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using existing static analysis tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed software projects. The chime framework provides a flexible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into software documents using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the chime specification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for software documents, into an existing, legacy software development environment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI. This paper describes the chime architecture, and describes our experience with several re-targeting efforts of this system.","inCitations":["693e11f86ae7bbd1b45f482da8602f214594e67c","60c0b2d68a9956e5c37107f2c4c4a5021f05cc47","90e2cf98c008d1280b4541b08a062b08a31ea918","2b58bd3497a90b69d3b19f7e1dc394c7246d235f","cd7177f2c0a1b2ad7465b870becaaa7190b752da","ed865ed216be68eef480e3906566c9c77eee7dde","09a230c7f0fca40a48b8f2070b6f8b6d44ae29ae","2ee181d793477e93acb1ac476e1ce6ddca86746b","e1edf3581e776a0943be4c9ac7f629ee86091ac0","53027ee722525b0c567927637cc84b8f01dbe529","e178f20011130776da99a083c17a6dedd2c61dc9","5740b000bff6af5ad5296e529ef01942b23db4b5","024a0ed61583e3e4c5c3cb6a8d5cc01c627a2de2","7ae5beab13ea691e3feb8571d419c64a2e6d9e66","0253d04c573d905b0dd2b0656a77e88cfe6cf97a","3d798b253b08f3645eb6f5b092b2219b25df6ca6","888c7922feb6a894e6140ac2f9e955d79291f85c","9f57f90bdcf5340e5fcfed78587c0f803661d490","9d8a6cb73e1959fac87942f2c1dc1f0c4f477893","ab02b80f482c3c34f85bd8e26ac38512dd6f7dc9","88c3d2bdce91430d24ed847086e115ae31c332e0","1d9edd257352711f57f6f3d67d721024fe15665a","60f8c05408545ce242f1ca0dd4b39bbcfde0e0af","5ba259b5df17f00c3cd09514f38eec6fa0ab8048","6ab322d8257edbb9ad4f4859b0112d2bbe1af5f4","4c12bf7749dc121a9b3928aaf835b45f329fad6b","68aef4f0e82336a9f3f24465f3335585828d3184","026f7c658fb51bac92d360a93f4b9943e506a771"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302679","http://castle.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","http://www.research.att.com/~chen/chen/chime.ps","http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/papers/pdfs/chime-98.pdf","http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","http://www.research.att.com/areas/visualization/papers_videos/pdf/DBLP-conf-icse-DevanbuCGMM99.pdf","http://www2.research.att.com/~erg/pdf/DBLP-conf-icse-DevanbuCGMM99.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emden_Gansner/publication/2632058_CHIME_customizable_hyperlink_insertion_and_maintenance_engine_for_Software_Engineering_Environments/links/02e7e517afa9ac85a4000000.pdf"],"title":"CHIME: Customizable Hyperlink Insertion and Maintenance Engine for Software Engineering Environments","doi":"10.1145/302405.302679","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302679","venue":"ICSE"}

Model checking is considered to be the broadest used formal verification technique, even though a great quantity of computing resources are needed to verify medium-large and large systems. As verification is prevent over the whole software process, these amount of resources is more critic in incremental and iterative life cycles. Our proposal focuses on reusing incomplete models and their verification results —which are obtained from a model checking algorithm— in order to improve these kind of life cycles. Making good use of these previous verification results can reduce the formal verification costs by minimizing the set of requirements and the set of system states where the properties must be verified.\nThe unspecification inherent to incomplete systems is used to provide an approximate and content-oriented retrieval which is supplemented by suggestions to match the desired specifications.","inCitations":["5da168c2a43c1056c9686c44251203c1063de45a","819b1cf5aa29a80a569baff362932bdd9cab65f8","8a0d023e93145b76c900df4240ccadb499348023"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185"],"title":"Reuse of Verificatino Efforts and Incomplete Specifications in a Formalized, Iterative and Incremental Software Process","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185","venue":"ICSE"}

When goals are assigned to an agent, they have to be operationalised: the agent’s operations have to be refined, by equipping them with appropriate enabling and triggering conditions, so that the goals are fulfilled. Goal operationalisation generally demands a significant effort of the engineer. Although there exist approaches that tackle this problem, they are either informal or at most semi automated, requiring the engineer to assist in the process. In this paper, we present an approach for goal operationalisation that automatically computes required preconditions and required triggering conditions for operations, so that the resulting operations establish the goals. The process is iterative, is able to deal with safety goals and particular kinds of liveness goals, and is based on the use of interpolation and SAT solving.","inCitations":["e83f2a143b061d63fca6e267ffe2f899f3dbda2e","a44afa0f820c7825a490727ae8ee787d77ed1fc2","6cbb40d4ddebecb756341a6350d56add94ab213f","d3b739f5acf1eb728808773dceac344391da9b08","2dbe44387c6142050af0432e2c0643bb86721de8"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2568225.2568323","http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/files/ICSE2014.pdf","http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2014/DAAU14/Automated%20Goal%20Operationalisation.pdf"],"title":"Automated goal operationalisation based on interpolation and SAT solving","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568323","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568323","venue":"ICSE"}

An important aspect of this template structure organization is that like instances of a data structure allocated at runtime share a common template rather than each allocated instance of a data structure having its own individual template. The motivation for sharing templates is derived from the fact that large numbers of data structures can be active at runtime, and templates can occupy a considerable amount of storage (in some instances a template can occupy as much or more storage than the data structure elements themselves). The importance of template sharing in a paging system, and the capability of the template structure for facilitating the design and implementation of general operations such as insert and delete are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807713"],"title":"The Design of a Template Structure for a Generalized Data Structure Definition Facility","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

PICFI starts with the empty CFG of a program and lazily adds edges to the CFG during execution according to concrete inputs. However, this CFG grows monotonically, i.e., invalid edges are never removed when corresponding control flow transfers (via indirect calls) become illegal (i.e., will never be executed again). This paper presents LPCFI, Live Path Control Flow Integrity, to more precisely enforce forward edge CFI using a dynamically computed CFG by both adding and removing edges for all indirect control flow transfers from function pointer calls, thereby raising the bar against control flow hijacking attacks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449497"],"title":"Live path control flow integrity","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195093","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195093","venue":"ICSE"}

An important step towards an engineering discipline of software is a formal basis for describing and analyzing these designs. In this paper we present a theory for one aspect of architectural description: the interactions between components. The key idea is to de ne architectural connectors as explicit semantic entities. These are specied as a collection of protocols that characterize each of the participant roles in an interaction and how these roles interact. We illustrate how this scheme can be used to de ne a variety of common architectural connectors. We provide a formal semantics and show how this leads to a sound deductive system in which architectural compatibility can be checked in a way analogous to type checking in programming

Many GUI programs share the Web's notion of browsing through data- and decision-trees. This paper compares the user's browsing power in the two cases and illustrates that many GUI programs fall short of the Web's power to clone windows and bookmark applications. It identifies a key implementation problem that GUI programs must overcome to provide this power. It then describes a theoretically well-founded programming pattern, which we have automated, that endows GUI programs with these capabilities. The paper provides concrete examples of the transformation in action.","inCitations":["c3f8688242f1016d1733e1834c378c693058d5c4","5248d7603aab867bf5b773165b9ab84c7f3af7ed","81477106f4b0688e1f873d3c71371fca381ba96a","a8cd528fb4fdcd5dcf590060b3ee78d40cb43d6e","19f65a7bc2dcce1e99fabdf7cdbc305ff1117801","2a484dd8ef47ffd835154a61575a5560e0bc5062"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://cs.brown.edu/people/sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/icse2002-gk.pdf.gz","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/icse2002-gk.ps.gz","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Graunke/publication/221554072_Advanced_control_flows_for_flexible_graphical_user_interfaces_or_growing_GUIs_on_trees_or_bookmarking_GUIs/links/0912f511149bfd7e87000000.pdf","http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581375","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/PL/paul.pdf"],"title":"Advanced control flows for flexible graphical user interfaces: or, growing GUIs on trees or, bookmarking GUIs","doi":"10.1145/581339.581375","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581375","venue":"ICSE"}

Crucial safety properties have to be guaranteed for all potential structural configurations. Testing cannot provide safety guarantees, while current model checking and theorem proving techniques do not scale for such systems. We present a verification technique for arbitrarily large multi-agent systems from the mechatronic domain, featuring complex coordination and structural adaptation. We overcome the limitations of existing techniques by exploiting the local character of structural safety properties. The system state is modeled as a graph, system transitions are modeled as rule applications in a graph transformation system, and safety properties of the system are encoded as inductive invariants (permitting the verification of infinite state systems). We developed a symbolic verification procedure that allows us to perform the computation on an efficient BDD-based graph manipulation engine, and we report performance results for several examples.","inCitations":["3ce6a9ae6b4bfb8ce13d0fd8ccb995d059088d88","a46230a34fe74912943445b80dba12a93e6bb362","3e5ad9540aafd24df392d0960d82ff281cac4d0e","fe8afeb731e911b7ceb89beb4c477b3ac95050f8","b63c9a6d9d113dd73564bd43324037cb18bcb668","627c72830018345a06566439fe626e45d44807fd","a31ddad8fae200bb49737e4dd0f74065ecd717b8","7932d8b39e6d176d856ace25c05f9158211662af","4c63a968387390d77e55d7dfb9c5888ce560a2fe","15f44429e80a21141f2e69d18c9e7d46a54f9ddd","99d9b9e18118e71a535ac84a459a5f48f9f17625","ba2c3482b2b03939b6ba357aa29bf24988f24fd2","10aac4932648f7e0d7b7bdb0156f65e238be1997","98f7009f4ef6f536fdf2acd03079eb7948753198","efb177475195815083634576ccf50372a0bf80fc","74962d2514f76f12b8539157c96c0297ff79fc9a","bec00aca1344dcf6b8176ed3fde789ecf7f4a8ce","9d57bd246c3e9b9e81128018c68ea2a5b080f28a","4f3ccb02de77cb418b993cb801cbe26202f32a02","a9854e490786947ba603e740e3691cfec55b48e7","2df7c219034a890a395591f1b183a997cbce93d8","2d614ae475a7c675d62b71b28df3247cb09e7a3d","00be8dc8fcf9e3623f3026c1d08b75680d13a476","9b930e349f8526da88d0325ffdc10a500006dc3a","3541de25f47e21afb3088e92f3b3d5d27bab1e52","b6540ee249962191f4ce7cfb6d7d9fd6ff98537e","08573bcd34af3d7def27e49b61b324e85485bd1f","9fb5f5ae46fe7133bd80bd068b31b6ebadbe8282","93d0b3381bc367490706a4cbb347a93d2e9e23a4","ede92f6f152814324c2acbf20fcaf6f723495930","be839fd15b7e6a8613e20ed42831c3a9d90f55ff","76d54613dd129aee59144ca601e9dbca4e6faf51","24f4bac812bef13f5552c7dbf3c58bf692f0492e","03c1723c3cf881acfe7a28777c3cf08d7f6ac7cc","6f831c1e415c18c1df94b18bb64d235beb3f9112","115045e0f551aa57b751c1c1910b8bd3348b82f0","067583c58c9e4cc4ff374ae1324ebd22e4e0de38","af6d4ba6352f993a456f7ebcb1e0439ae668fa41","837b9ec682d817f166fbc94ed6bd7c1016c8a82f","9b51663cb52d77515d0fec8b19585e6cf346d1e1","23376219845dd0aef9e2b558ad4e155d36606b25","c167191bbd00423c653aa118cec720d42af8cc6d","336bdb4fc8aabbdf15e6ac559020f72489d91761","d325900e92e7d81c59fc03d33e218c16ab4346cd","4dae47702a12090f2f5ea1ca32618c4f7a1d6880","dcbb1923f530bb739b043cf0d4a6589f186a0c3f","d710d0c4d71b49dbad4c0d8823d2b1d0c22cc29a","9b2c16753882ef31ee4f2197de6d231f425fe9d9","0bd9fbfc39bc64f21529fdd0f14e8b2f04c27b1b","781f0885afe6a9e7a5c3c6ed8ab1203b35059a41","8c290052b166d4db233d78bc2a8b376f0448c70d","07bec50d9ff90d1f69091bc95471a23f880c058f","3123442e9384878bd7790cb7a74a41754f1635bb","9d710018767e8740a340fd2a78ef1f767eda919e","eb62cf5246a446d3a4e90ed13828c464a1492852","57ab630eb7eca61b3e820c50c46e878effdf007e","990e921d16d733202412808500cf975088b8707f","d3dbb5cc2949f99abe22b239a61e6a8f463b48ab","02afb4276810695a3e54197c175f46a15f01def4","f12911e7bdd7a0868d9d084a502ebc1bd56de53a","d675511201335d6848a09e5a70b27dda279a3c72","3db456048d0cad524d7e4ce073b9ca7a1980b95c","c3ba0f4b93d31a1e058985f5449edbcf5adf96c0","7e13e143659fef8227e410dc279f10c6fb4f1f29","05237186be2776d0a33ca93132eaaffd39ac037b","fac1b561302c3d3a2c425708006c93f8ea66f465","7fdeb32f567e18f0258507c8cdfc5d8054289ba3","b2d27100b824a2bb9e625ea6708583381a69db18","d444b4f3b9b521a47f9abd0b4449b2c24bee3ba8","45886362a8445075b3c15cf9563a11e2bbe91c44","6560e2064592495f8894b7de937741b757314756","c819dc34cc722f6f94506002860cea9305d2b586","627765744b107e94650c6dd02ef1c77724c3b08b","7da9540739e117dcf89e20cac062cf1f120bfb41","42e1f3014bdde00fbf10943599891699a246b422","fee5958f3e8fb9e6698ced81f1ec7bd531791c31","5b0b5cccd82e457a450c81bd08eea7e025baa270","49a80c3fd0ddbd5d2bed4ca3ea0f814b47a7d401","08b4440f517af4aa1d205c2403b4c49d07082ec2","55ff693d78fd6d97a38736e7f1ddb9e44d4d3ad3","f928dbc2e346cf375545a13e355057cfc7f105eb","0dc387faad5e889eece0f8e872e1b6ee08653128","ce02ba73b00a97c63bd7608f3af1bd997f1360a6","4bf9799972e5d832db797df17aaada5c45078c88","bfa9b324c1b14934b67b62fd5cf49dee05aa7704"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.sosy-lab.org/research/pub/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~dbeyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134297","http://www2.cs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/ag-schaefer/Veroeffentlichungen/Quellen/Papers/2006/icse2006.pdf","http://mtc.epfl.ch/~beyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/daniekro/classes/se-sem/ss2007/papers/yury/Symbolic%20invariant%20verification..p72-becker.pdf","http://www.sosy-lab.org/~dbeyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p72.pdf"],"title":"Symbolic invariant verification for systems with dynamic structural adaptation","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134297","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134297","venue":"ICSE"}

To avoid committing irrevocable tasks followed by exceptions, B2B processes, which guarantee the atomicity sphere property, are attractive. While atomicity sphere ensures its outcomes to be either all or nothing, conflicting local recoveries may lead to global B2B inconsistencies. Existing (global) analysis techniques however mandate every process unveiling all individual tasks. Such an analysis is infeasible when some business parties refuse to disclose their process details for privacy or business reasons. To address this problem, we propose a process algebraic technique to prove, construct, and check atomicity-equivalent public views from B2B processes. By checking atomicity spheres in the composition of these public views, business parties can identify suitable services that respect their individual and overall atomicity requirements. An example based on a real-life multilateral supply chain process is included.","inCitations":["4def5671c1a0f261e68bc27233d243c6ade8788c","57147efbcf6ea172c7742f10dd054464b3dfe73b","3d3e46c47a097d1f002d405821e1b27deaa7c4ed","0fd49277e7ad0b0ef302f05ebcca772d28e34292","0e798e1b9a19ebf46ff8230293a9a7fc0c9b6970","fd5362f163321ad9f3c1b7dcb090cfac98e09a2e","d5744b9be475f7655e94b0d420f44500d773ea41","1f3df1c78785a4e17869cfd57177a9a12937d263","5f9010c0bc97f3e350ed56e69738c4c5bee07d25","4a0e96c1ca3a1bb619dfff6bacb969df1ff48901","1a716bf99f76f120d3efe87d62b5c24d5e21173f","ce8640ef0f90be23c6b66729ac43629dc4904047","1e7dc1b8833a2b21a54bd5d155eb67e16d9aa2c9","6f6bc6af0324a5fc63ee1939b4351105bf94c509","f08375d3f57278ff97a3e398b4fdc08a67dd2d20","b3e8f25d0858d5d111b5d382816cda3b5a2b23a1","7b4db1f6bd6044a2994a885cae0de892b9e21ea2","47e8757f7f9569b2c17c375c07818d3cccbbac92","51bc65ffa9775ddffea32271614d2330a90f579f","1549062634f368fc59cff6cb0c016766492115f1","abb905715550422141694c618544f62d249453ef","2aa1aaaf41925904cd3a9b5b931775fbd14430ad","2aea4d4bdbc29b38448ce4966a4758d1225d5c19"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/papers/icse06-ye+cheung+chan.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chunyang_Ye/publication/221554158_Publishing_and_composition_of_atomicity-equivalent_services_for_B2B_collaboration/links/0deec5180d8b4cb477000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134335"],"title":"Publishing and composition of atomicity-equivalent services for B2B collaboration","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134335","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134335","venue":"ICSE"}

We describe the design, execution, and analysis of the expem”ment so others may reproduce it and test our results for diflerent kinds of software developments and different populations of software engineers.","inCitations":["52e5526731300e97a97cd6e0d5460f4c961b940f","5149002061a59fe2c993373e6e012d35e111c639","7da816d0f1d2a2b33d6512a1e694c04cbe4d4963","acdede88f2827a8aad5945538b30ad643170a6e8","306b711cc4e20782c21d16ab4c3e8c71622842eb","07553b809551f463a226eb813a0a119b246dbb6c","451cdb11f22dad8321f5075c66e52cc32047c32b","30b30b2da89e9a287f235cdec1d346de163e50c5","c63c35894b93fe74f4518751a1ca38ab80512a72","22e5e0983824342959b2a627ee54062b0cd4e1d4","6c232f41439101668bd9be8a9d38b088f1621566","4b57016284e27819ae02954bd05720a6b5a4f438","738af5fe157f4ce39f3a3554db8cda02af0a9131","dc8de9350f6bea2b08465a5fcf853a060cda6b8b","cb23dfc0f607e5dc2c64676213320baa92d883fb","a017bc5d72eb789692e34e87c0ed75d15b941939","addeba398c9e9b882ce94c903c57b74f3646b92f","2cc27a92a3f1348de7d3447706fc2bf7b674a598","b245b233798afd7bbaf64b0102a4f2c45a660669","768862fa4b9201b867250725c85b6ca1354e0778","1015ceea2997701b3c74d32d9d5950a57ea600a6","c10e485183af46aa6639879d41ceffe98c134023","10a4222334165a758c800a79ed746a8210969d30","fa1b15b38c34695926dfe806fafc5a1b80cdbcfc","72c506a6b0a1f77f06f6ed1275221db367c6aac2","6783f8d4020e7e263bf5616c263aa80f5e89b66f","eb794459d9c980a0af39e26f99a4442ed4d85241","0458edc90b6a4fbcc351d9ba16e89b9fe08c3d49","a20f5415ee7d771aac7c50b28523c963de7a3245","17de8a46aa89924870f9beeb28bdbe9033482972","9efae273d9213b46254116e3a68fcd6ffe0debdf","9323e28f1a2139bd291e8bc3e248432d13f5666b","fc2cff71aa7b6147618e83a16e6b5e384acbe26f","3a6bf8316149cb57791e3f40450e0d2231e59f4e","919694869a997ba2a4a9d43473a62d3fe6065e42","8cee8b7db053ea80f6b472e60180ecd926abe9f2","86a4daaee147bfcfd90b7996f1fb3dd9e336708c","b0bfc79524415fb18cf8f56673f5b7218925769b","68f660790f29dba84dd5cfdbf0ed9f66060fb0ac","01afbdd9dae109d199a204315ed24d7a8055b75f","89d4f0afd2a4b8a68b3f40093894287689056133","21fe4bb6972bbee893a3e2383067c7931c3fcd95","6e4b62f6ee1090e00f0dc4205cb412555e895acd","94e5fd9705487e82d5e757e95eaceab9488861de","77f5399e3a7a7f11a407d8d7ae777730d43a5fb7","35a3e7cbd023483b4535991de804aa171a2fb71e","51256edcdb4f794cd44b07019874c37c39df5229","6fd4ea1566e259030d9e5ecd341ac33743785bfa","169b6b0fffa99ed5115f970f61701ded2c7611b0","6df713aec8736d2843e5370d33ce265a9b2bc571","1525dbe4f44cbbc635fdd5f5f4c5aa20c96efef7","363fb257c5e3b656820317f62592ae1b328fb68a","8b16a9b1eb45ffb5bb8fa3cdd52c9e7d679d2cd0","5c7896628a87a36bdf83096c425d6efa8c88cfd8","50c34e4ca32220c5a7134e6b3c1971927d0a54a2","6789fe4a27eef636e944cafd819592f6a3ff8880","21a906870972675ccfc7f7c2a0eeb37d319a7152","5b7008622426b6100c344efff4a76832e7d47400","1ca957f0be5800b2f69c49de463fe56603d6218e","63801bdfedb3ccc6c64bc8310f762db945f0b931","6439e8d64543f7b3f9b02af3e521c5b6fb5e1583","9269601d66f80c4d289e4c39677ed365b7df9f68","a49a601e7998e1485581e91a8f881ac4c509fbf0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bell-labs.com/~votta/work/papers/icse16.ps","http://www.cs.umd.edu/~aporter/icse16.ps","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257749"],"title":"An Experiment to Assess Different Defect Detection Methods for Software Requirements Inspections","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

These projects have been started without sufficient previous training given to the developers. An increment in the productivity has been seen as the projects progress. This paper proposes a simulation model for software development which can deal with variances of developers’ productivity during software development. As the proposed model takes into account the developer’s learning curve, it can be used to compute a developer’s productivity and the quantity of gain to the developer’s knowledge in executing an activity. The proposed model has been applied to four typical scenarios in our case study. The results show that it is highly practicable. An outline of a project planning prototype which is based on the proposed model is presented. The prototype can be used to make project plans which take the developer’s learning curve into consideration.","inCitations":["a734b2ea75cb1a2e3601858137858b8250a23cd9","df0a7a8af5f686110c59c2e71e9575830fa118a7","2e177f064cae471cf21c7368b0f7e5cbe51fc22a","9f222c747762b8cdb048611009af955e5f69e267","298c32bf050911746af55c7b0b1224ffe8ddb30a","7c82889f759c777632b23f8ec3394abdfbcb95d8","d79ff97959de2c857eb24fef3df71d1154f3307e","c599e09091a22c756ac4a3ec14c184be2aaa30b6","6d580911fc3f09a0b7eafb01d9b752e45f517afb","60b759d45cd2035f09f415c73d64741caeb131c0","3d59981ac1d62cc6280b8805e72bdf5806e16c6e","95f65ffdeb5f39ac1cb0feb27302a68f08ea5a92","1cc558c7cd501a4331c1ee2a3b5e279c5a9c115d","5be726452ba803874dc999bbbeb74bd79c60149f","4e806a7a22aede0da412a32af97ae79c59309da9","a1747b0a5791a7def4debe7917bc8148b97b4660","4e80f3f01e975ff0474ea90bfdc477c479f4cdd5","4b3c13f4ac36ace7fd5df85feb6b24ec29953724","39a2592b92c21363fb6bea47bd019dac6549c183","ebb333138ba75560a0c0059a5bcd5ad36bb62461","18fa5f9762f64ed3d5b4873d0bc8eef298fc2b69","b1266659f8de3efc3507c6a970ffd6ccb212ff83","3bb8e86fc97a49f43af79e3f440332aca6622d0a","a023f6d6c383f4a3839036f07b1ea0aa04da9cbb","3e31f3e8a8e90d95729a88845139cf5f7484a820"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388"],"title":"A Learning Curve Based Simulation Model for Software Development","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388","venue":"ICSE"}

A complexity metric, called DU, is defined for the control graph of a structured program. This new metric is different from other control-graph based metrics in that it is based on “representative” data flow information in a control graph. An algorithm for computing the value of DU(G) for a control graph G is given. The lower and upper bounds of DU(G) are provided. The DU metric is shown to have several advantages over other control-graph based complexity metrics.","inCitations":["2c2ef792c2c524cc76b9e2620e542433443218d9","145cb89e3f7a52b1df75d02f8b830c31b2fea8f0","aed72606d64f60164991e4e37799cc135efc17a8","090ee32efd8759801bf9681b3549431e06aa1c68","963888277904ba2e01e6e257b58aa58c39b344e0","67e7942a57b89c2d3d13da667956014ae4831729","33ba91b7dbe68e5a082f38e9ebf23a70ae5ae00a","3d8ef68e2b65cf2e6c6e3ecda3db5645cbd31bf4","aef930c488424d11ffaa643d8ded03d7f0373d3d","4c6e8a888e3d2cdd6ae97b5e59e1acb6072bc042","d8ae20f22aabb8d08cbabb939842f91aea04c967","c7571095c7d59ce0e1014b518dc5a45d64fa78bd","bd23c3f20bb5613b938bb9d5d1913167db7b1491","637f974b3a7166f25dfea053e977d9d328c763be","193b3a3e28ec80665065a331dbb3fd4c5cfefb7a","e3aae4823f42d987e1d934077b2d5cb8f3f58eb3","191128f6070278f4f1ed89943ef6885f71a6e4d5","2c6d971c3e638a43aa4a8f9567e908780491d9e8","22424e71407ab3ba66a61b3b03e91fa67161faa0","28fecea3023292b9c4d9c3a597dc988097727798","e16d1d161db4811b37fd856d3ab001503137beb3"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801976"],"title":"A Program Complexity Metric Based on Data Flow Information in Control Graphs","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The theory describes how component developers can design and test their components to produce measurements that are later used by system designers to calculate composite system reliability — without implementation and test of the system being designed. The theory describes how to make component measurements that are independent of operational profiles, and how to incorporate the overall system-level operational profile into the system reliability calculations. In principle, the theory resolves the central problem of assessing a component, which is: a component developer cannot know how the component will be used and so cannot certify it for an arbitrary use; but if the component buyer must certify each component before using it, component-based development loses much of its appeal. This dilemma is resolved if the component developer does the certification and provides the results in such a way that the component buyer can factor in the usage information later, without repeating the certification. Our theory addresses the basic technical problems inherent in certifying components to be released for later use in an arbitrary system.\nMost component research has been directed at functional specification of software components; our theory addresses the other, equally important, side of the coin: component quality.","inCitations":["073d8f38d483affbab631905e06ab7e2307e807f","c3d6b31e4ab88d156054104660c9d22f3b572419","17e3e2532c85cfa82819a1ec4b6fc630c0c2f4a8","a66f6ac1226dd787eddff719511fe814d22eb651","1f0774eb8ef13971a545dbdc406d7560a073bbc9","e97b6b863cb77c4b624f63f48b8a9690f12943a5","c011c58320d90155edc48d525ed33b316aa7358b","b43e3e0bd06913d26c0ca0044de4a21c0dae1e45","cdeb4d108bfe1529f33cbaba04638a637d3cd797","6f9fc90b208ed614901fb507f51d09b98bd3bec5","9fa73f416de151739cb47a0ea71f390bdd4e2792","b2a6dbb0f0257eb66b8c6c796a98141116eac79c","c3b655e86bfbbccf511eacc2951b729ca3c20932","8f1b52e03c654293e6e3b70808e33c422650e219","4b717ccd0aa1647a1a10eea221e7c56369b95dd2","9b7fc599cd90c2f8a4191df952468748a888c323","430b44723ec4e8ac653db8d843962aee4ccc9efe","76a5c9246aabe1c874316f206f58e16e4c02ca88","608b0676ac604453e4c9d9cdcdfbe2d86d9141a4","5cb8de47191be5b3cc64c90d2b4687e3dedf2e1c","fea1a0943c584d07626c6dc6a4614d27574eb2ab","7dcad42398cf998a8a27ea8bb1a160271bddcd6d","ab6d800f0aed1930519a263ff859b32296f8cef7","ee2c04fb9f9c2d0e1605f93489b0198e26b64af1","29bb343a4f6045ee2250372e29270faea63524d9","2034cf67c9d1863d7c53047d80b6ee2d6b5a571f","f1f231827cb4157178ceb4ef65b3ef9d7a9305fd","5def6f816b0cbb7c1b4d21a953c135b95d5c5896","d766df28b3b3dc000d700c4bee34b513ff9c03ea","414a1f2225fe64f0b846ed825ecd47032de5e13c","a4df1d27363af2ad73d67f992282bb281adc8442","aede417618b184697d4ef3a318000a1c496a2542","eeac147b507e02e765cb7c2682aa67cbe6f641f9","d574f77b38e083373992be6d732f5b18b4fd763b","3dea9d5f3a650d6caa05ce40a5f79e23c1e19180","a80f00121cca0fb0724e158b8e2e431c89df2396","a03fe3fe4e36c9afc99c2ff66896db39ad864250","5869c79c230e7d6c5cb7ae3ee743fac0e16f2b95","73590a5e642186bf54d4603de011c52ac2ffce86","d0ae4017412d2b93f1df6914ceffea2094aa851d","03917679596b9619f65f855d339b4402bf762df4","d3567378054b686f27b622d01173a5e12c327428","5cf6bb4819b20c9003771644df904de73eff268e","03ac081eacf80d2468757c412a3ac35016c4f964","ab8455cf457d5c4145137144f934b8af59d8fa56","5d854d599c096ac4d3e206d056b9bef7873283e8","9696192d3debc2005fa2c949db213d94a36351a8","dfff40d433901e8e81717ba1bf62fe27e634e620","c7702164cc62992c2b31650014fd238ae866ba68","00dd012d3cd7e415c03eb569c94a74201b063760","11254462c61e3fb98eb0fb6ae7f1dabad148b316","3bc9ae3afb1398ac4a68c4df6adfc234836c2cab","d6953f7104cae029eb309b8581242ba2e59022af","616dd9d1f33e6ce8485702d9f9825719bbd3d5b8","6f7d16a3ac5b6aaa01d39cc3a22bf548331e9173","fd6e5e11033700fb0b75715b99ea6b7cc7865586","da0afe1005f63cebca084e4526ff497da60b84e2","add8cb35dfaa1ad2e5ccc909a598a8e9c7a4bb18","ff3f77c45a8cfd844dfcbff41a6c13844b9bbfc6","e81eb19c4fce496a0108cc31b4f9b479a1ec4138","6ac5a0d9372616805a02498cdeec7a05b7b5be5b","799399affe74ab8cd9d06dbd953f81b9ef876c0a","e0242f16cf182f5aeb1cffff230578a8551da5ce","10357f796885991762046a1401f5abc53ab5fe4a","097b2b4625942bf7f441f18735a4c0d9ab50c1dd","b42afb789d32cfe5dcc0ef182cf528b9e56ccc91","8c74ec77b8f25563be717785b5fa16a2b4671292","5362ff1f8ef303c4f470a700d53a667a3dafb362","730e8eacb8bee94e3b2f11c5b8bec0b34d1a33d8","c98b198da701c21bea4907881361e2595d51858f","97299ed2585a3b4f95aed91d0b5b01085813908a","3654ded5636c73b27a5d6efb93bcc40c0f7d114c","72041bc681edea4c8502a067a598e7de370cca7d","d08bc1f632d90da6ae8c129eedd1328eaea50f84","7753ec8d742c049c027943ff20e4d0e4d0be8dc1","d4a9676686c7e50e524425340851baef72d33c82","c204d76f49993002b025377add3597f4e4ab4c23","c9710b54606938efce360e29d9bbd97bde3e0375","7925cc4d22c2120f9712ad5c3d2e865259c02980","bce231710d1fb2b601ef53dfdeeb3cfa98782f26","1ff30832a5ee49cf0ec04029fb374acaeb34549e","942807387b0d5f44715d9b669ba2713a59b42043","02ef2ffb1105928334877bb99bca7a9868f23757","0726208a36cd8983ad5774d9a2b528e286439326","041ea35574feb0ba125ed4bb26ba97b62f3d7fb5","39c5a25f6b3f550bc6bd4ab0c6765b5350cab143","d518d02e75536e9e8870905c4df59b381f9be6f0","13a959fa5f9ee8e62b9c724f32c144f8ed530d11","d7c402da2e86f119607c7d43fec0119fc58a43ee","027d6a6e43751c7eede2140ed57cd413b5effa2d","b83d8f55b0c41946c99c0828d04dfa6173e1ee79","0537bad016d8f2e09bcb40c01f83d12de4bc95b1","8745ca68fb0abf3c3d5bcf6111cdc58f3b65119a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.ps.Z","http://www.deeds.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/events/meetings/05/Hamlet_TheorySWReliabilityComponents_icse.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.pdf","http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.pdf"],"title":"Theory of Software Reliability Based on Components","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","venue":"ICSE"}

It provides an alternative scenario-centric approach to architecture development. The combination of scenarios and Unified Modeling Language (UML) semantics is referred to as the Naval Architecture Environment (NAE). Specifically, it recommended the acquisition of Rational Rose. The NAE combines the best practices of software development with the domain-specific insight contained in the Framework to create an efficient process, supported by a commercial tool and robust semantics, to allow the analysis and design of interoperable C4ISR systems. These are systems that will support Joint Vision 2010's call for Information Superiority. Tools have been developed which allow tactical data to be exchanged over Internet Protocol networks, but the quality of service necessary to operate these tools is not available for most Naval vessels at this time. The objective of this thesis is to show that using Multicast IP, distributing data in layers using an efficient protocol, and sending data with no inherent mechanism to ensure that packets arrive at their destinations will allow data to be exchanged over IP networks at much lower bandwidths than is required today while still maintaining a common tactical picture. Software was developed which interfaces to GCCS-M and exchanges data over a multicast network. This software was tested in a laboratory which simulated a Naval environment. The results of testing demonstrate the potential of using the characteristics of the track data being exchanged in a true multicast architecture to develop a efficient tactical data distribution system for users operating in the Naval environment.","inCitations":["dc46d71e9817f0d5f8467dfef83bc0dbd507e9b6","0c9e6ff678c31387fe243a808f1cba8beb89e9ad","5f5ab0f0f69231c31a287eb9dde93299721937f7","95a8a21ef5b33692348f771b7f8e07617d573962","e43806026988327b7b2dbb7f67eee4fb3d6be0cd","700e0a5776480847591b370ec2c08889862cb768","45fff80ba582bbc1d12c1aa5d23e1f1dbdbb9b79","d06b951c0ae7adaf5f9ca7740c8e071a917555fd"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802960"],"title":"Software Engineering: Management, Personnel and Methodology","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

But the focus of attention has shifted in recent years. Early work emphasizing the study of languages for defining processes was rapidly eclipsed by process evaluation and improvement work, most notably the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). As process improvement has matured as a strategy and philosophy it has also given rise to a strong reaction to the perception that it is unduly ponderous and constraining. Movements such as Extreme Programming (XP) have cast themselves as lightweight alternatives, emphasizing the primacy of freedom and flexibility. Both philosophies and communities continue to grow in size, development, and depth of understanding.The goal of this panel will be to explore the differences between these major approaches to the use of process in software development by bringing together leading articulate exponents of the approaches. Each panelist will be charged with presenting a very concise characterization of the approach being represented. But the focus of the panel will be on understanding the nature of the differences in approach, and the reasons for these differences. Similarities will be sought as well.An underlying hypothesis of the panel is that the differences in approach arise in large measure from differences in objective and differences in assumptions about the software development context. Thus, for example, one approach may be intended to support very long range organizational objectives, while the other may be more tactically oriented. One approach may assume that evolvability is an overriding objective, while another may be more focused on speed to market. One may make stronger assumptions about the skills and training of project personnel. The panel will attempt to delve into these issues to see if it may be possible to suggest criteria for suggesting which approach (and possible adaptation) should be selected for a given development situation.In a larger sense, the goal of this panel is to suggest the possibility of a discipline of software process engineering. Insofar as the panel is able to suggest that development situations can be used to guide the selection of process approaches to the provision of assistance, might this then be an indication that process formalisms could play a role in subsequent specification of detailed processes, and evaluation of their effectiveness?The panel will react to this and related questions. While lively interchanges among the panelists will be stimulated and expected, similar interchanges with the audience will also be cultivated.","inCitations":["f4656515bf31d18fd0a7c7ac3d1270ec85c592fc"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581426"],"title":"Lightweight vs. heavyweight processes: is this even the right question?","doi":"10.1145/581339.581426","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581426","venue":"ICSE"}

Action Language forms an interface between transition system models that a model checker generates and high level specification languages such as Statecharts, RSML and SCR—similar to an assembly language between a microprocessor and a programming language. We show that Action Language translations of Statecharts and SCR specifications are compact and they preserve the structure of the original specification. Action Language allows specification of both synchronous and asynchronous systems. It also supports modular specifications to enable compositional model checking.","inCitations":["c125bda6fb804330c0f19ac876e031a847ed040d","4e10c848cb7ed3cd8f3bafeefb1720833d58c80e","45aafc86141267ceab0e824d80762acd7b805d47","39d8c3b607976148df4a25eb96316cd610abea05","a1156609916f52e7a7b4150461f172188de796ae","35bcf2486fc32d9a5b8e912d448338387571a2ed","0a65d8353267046dfaf2a61400062b009708e7bc","4552673b6a06264f6de3c83bb826b66909f8656a","1ea6653d892ce2c4bc35567ec07be558e45eac01","d94e2fc9476f079963b00499b4d42aa820639dbb","594d7fcf8e81f28b53f08349cfa88a875814fc8d","428f7f329858051296cdd38d13be5c2e337a3937","fb2b0d744138fe0d5a5b0f589ab915ac41f6c404","c87ee2d4580a50361fe7aae3da8c2a9104973dac","4a544a85c314781b874a578022fd87424cc87e4a","63d3058fc8c72536ff82de61765dd76a6998a9cc","3f2903614d337af29e96dba5aa555164b39a9918","26d34d204095549bd45e7e1cb5a29942e78904f4","03c465c75de13b66369f1500996e364a88c2181d","0a29839a46d8ffc084d7e764c6d106295f2d1674","425ac2503689a9a82182613782b2ab886554b672","4a27d940c578da238eda3ef393ed8a3aa9a9e9c7","09105f031a7193f8f3f4276e9ae6aa08f0bc635d","7e0115601d9961b4349343cca540b01cd2ce3aa7","258a8c6710a9b0c2dc3818333ec035730062b1a5","c624efe61bbb965e4f54d3114e728db39d7d9cb5","0c34620bfdd0869d1d4fc9a342e89a8d74e53749","d27d7440b7d9d276c65c885dd2bdfc85a9627cc3","0d2773b8cf4d5a6ca5bb05d0373989111ec00d83","2e5eed5d714e944cec6210df58e6ce0d6100cf89"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337219","http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~bultan/publications/icse00.ps"],"title":"Action Language: a specification language for model checking reactive systems","doi":"10.1145/337180.337219","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337219","venue":"ICSE"}

So, these data or models are only helpful when they match the WC context well. When they do not, a fair amount of WC training data, which are usually expensive to acquire, are still necessary to achieve good performance. We investigate how to make best use of CC data, so that we can reduce the amount of WC data while maintaining or improving performance in comparison to WC SEE models. This is done by proposing a new framework to learn the relationship between CC and WC projects explicitly, allowing CC models to be mapped to the WC context. Such mapped models can be useful even when the CC models themselves do not match the WC context directly. Our study shows that a new approach instantiating this framework is able not only to use substantially less WC data than a corresponding WC model, but also to achieve similar/better performance. This approach can also be used to provide insight into the behaviour of a company in comparison to others.","inCitations":["0457771cccdac72e8b5bf52bc2ef03ff3197393e","f99b6ee01fa8b363e3b032574eb6bdea2c0164ab","f641c4ef600897420f455953bea35f37556e4ba4","b78622789d01c4c9a951605164decb30c6ac1507","38cc302b9204c222316a2ed34813f16d42e5c7b4","a0330203b9292498aefc7b6cf11378a964c91fde","216932333a3cee5456ca50b29b06edbad1d0409f","de41592c20b21afb76517d3e2ef99b66beae5536","6b844e8d01bc4da829d5b239bcc3d2820cc01339","4ab760d05de6a761574296ce4fbba4c575ae13db","7b3442b107da32174e9d9e5dcd9b826709df39c0","c6f9192c2a3cc3fc68f758aa4edb5fcfc61d426a","4c316967cd8a59f07aa869e3f25b49e99c02c8d1","415a4e665b4316f5cf0a8c9290b9cf71efa64b69","48a81cc7fc0cf288f12feea04111e0207046e2ff","301e5fe8ce4cc82f58ada3b5d5b2c36195cfb959","383734ad2f97c14502210ebdefa5b4638bd1f826","3582918462f3e4a363c9fc431a61e28d470fd680","57594d304f41006116bbc0e311495be6614919bc","1c5fb3c531786008de7e7783b6b78245cc61ea41","e0f644531fa46cb08d65db11a5b27a552c5763c7","55346fc5380e70bc6efd9cecedb842c92eb180be","441d7d7d61a04177446ab13eefd1b733c49a1aa1","178a226a4fa68d80f709d0cfff5f5458df0daad3","7f9d8661ade486e6ccfbbf572097a101973225ca"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568228","http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~minkull/publications/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/llm11/publications/slidesMinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~minkull/publications/slidesMinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/14899606/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/llm11/publications/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf"],"title":"How to make best use of cross-company data in software effort estimation?","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568228","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568228","venue":"ICSE"}

Campo","ids":["1710506"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Aspect-oriented technologies are increasingly promoting new ways of developing software in order to better control change and improve software adaptability and evolution. Current aspect technologies make now available novel means to achieve the principle of separation of concerns. However, aspect-oriented development still appears strongly attached to the underlying programming approach used to support it, rather than to design mechanisms guiding development. Supporting aspects at the design phase can greatly improve aspect-oriented development, because aspects can be identified and incorporated earlier in the development process. Therefore, tools or CASE environments assisting developers to bridge the gap between aspect-based design specifications and these AOP technologies are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, we propose an approach for enhancing aspectoriented software development considering aspects as first-class design entities. The proposal puts together lines of research coming from different fields, namely: aspect-oriented frameworks, aspect models extending UML models, knowledge-driven framework documentation and agent-based planning. The concept of smart-weaving promotes essentially an early incorporation of aspects in the development cycle, so that designers would be able to specify their designs by means of aspect models, reuse parts of these models, and also provide different strategies to map generic aspect structures to specific implementations. With this purpose, we have built an experimental environment called Smartweaver aiming to support this process. The kind of assistance provided by the tool relies on the Smartbooks method, a method extending traditional techniques for framework documentation. Smartbooks is based on agent technology, more precisely, it includes a special planning agent that is able to derive the sequence of activities that should be executed to implement a given functionality from a target framework. In order to do so, framework designers need to supply some information to the agent in advance.

Copyright 2002 ACM 1-58113-472-X/02/0005...$5.00. is described through a predefined format of rules that we call the Smartbooks documentation method. The method prescribes that the framework designer should describe the fimctionality provided by the framework, how this functionality is implemented by different framework components, and provide rules to somehow constraint the ways the framework can be specialized. In particular, this method was applied to the case of aspect-oriented frameworks. The Smartweaver tool takes advantage of these ideas and provides an UML-based environment where developers can define both classes, aspects and crosscutting relationships among them. All this graphical information is collected by a special tool, which is also provided with adequate knowledge about how to map generic aspectual specifications into a given AOP implementation support. In our case study, we used the AspectModerator Framework (AMF). Then, the Smartweaver engine is able to combine this domain knowledge to derive an instantiation plan to implement the desired aspectual behavior. Very briefly, in order to apply smart guidance on an given application it is necessary to accomplish the following activities: build a smartbook of support technology, design the target application, then add smart-weaving documentation, and finally put all these things together. The visual formalism developed to specify aspect models, as an extension of conventional UML diagrams, intends to be independent of particular AOP implementation technologies. This favors communication among aspect developers, promoting a common documentation model for aspect-based applications. In later design stages, developers are free to decide which rules will map these models into a given AOP technology. From this perspective, it would be possible to have a general-purpose tool, and add such aspect technologies as plug-in packages. These packages would define a corpus of Smartbooks-based knowledge to map aspect models into particular AOP technologies. At this moment, a basic UML-compliant CASE environment integrated with the Smartweaver engine has been developed. This prototype currently supports a part of the features provided by commercial tools such as Rational Rose or Together, however, we are planning to improve these capabilities in the future. Regarding the Smartweaver engine, it still presents some limitations. Not all the instantiation actions can be derived if there is not enough knowledge available. For these reasons, we have started to explore the possibilities of increasing the agent's reasoning capabilities with more advanced reasoning techniques, as casebased reasoning and bayesian networks.","inCitations":["c92230444e4d9feea079000147dfde3a47e79233","cd1bfbaf7ab66be25f02b15cc72ae5c784a35d85"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581467"],"title":"Smartweaver: an agent-based approach for aspect-oriented development","doi":"10.1145/581339.581467","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581467","venue":"ICSE"}

Fifteen projects using a COTS-based approach were studied and their actual process was documented. This process is evaluated to identify essential differences in comparison to traditional software development. The main differences, and the activities for which projects require more guidance, are requirements definition and COTS selection, high level design, integration and testing.\nStarting from these empirical observations, a new process and guidelines for COTS-based development are developed and briefly presented. The new process is currently under experimentation.","inCitations":["61884e9665ca96a1b92103a954722c933bfd44e9","163bc02d13dd125f67fcca91debdfb585801b252","028944e596bbe7fa553bb87286514e0efa1e78fd","81885c59570909b2eed7e0f8adb50f30d4047311","5e155b5ce79d7ac8de602f59d1ff4052bb734081","4236d279ca7265e61dfd3c07e6942688c725386a","f0d90607806643b2b2913d012d36692be51d2fea","57c8ca8c1ead02e63f709c9e4d97581608c52732","63b4896cb051a3f346492f0c42c121052f4af649","46b8e73718d0f20123f94330bd27a052edb19301","027d71ff9f579336f0cf54591fb35bff72bf1c52","ea4c0ab8eb3a5f88a314c1884654c5d767ccbd3b","d23165b35c2f696d8245e2b432aa912a72c78331","edea818baba0d37250085a5fd772017f86e7f6ae","90cc1d5dea24d1475a29b2955df3cb71902702b6","dc39e5db5f0cfbe833f1e1a4cbe7f30ffb3f5140","16d67241624f3bbf7bdff5a9b3bf160fa41d2962","8f6a7b85806fcd50b605ef2c2a412c8ac1ee618c","d04f8cc9ba743166482d815ff71e236cb4f46577","4dd993846378c5ae50a6eeeec223b6a11974bf04","668f340e8e501cd7f2eb35188a3af46f7ed9c765","380bddec5b598ecc6188208ed0b3c662d34ca50a","4ea6d09d69309e2dabe4e62294009bbc2445f812","0dea41c60cc14828134f9af0bd2f9ee3f1677850","b2316a59212610d47af9b88aa62fb25ab2d58de9","692f8393409177baeb04a5e226d9beeab096346e","4296c418385f7aca5414645abf0bfe84358125f5","0fd3077e56f2725f74cf9670a5d1b3f18ee7a38f","aa6da71c3099cd394b9af663cfadce1ef77cb37b","95ea8463ff9bc7f75d41fe36deb2cc30236246b8","90ba553f798f6c66f38bfe7539e17562c8aa560d","f1ffd15696702383b595b4d522b2a3797b33809e","51f1db2e85660d6d4f121422147893cf7aa638a7","8186c2da99cfcbcbf6b4c6a202dc4cddb3ba979f","533367299ef177e7471205b4af62654cb75f478a","0f1c22eb239f6494cac2db71d304d893ebd87fcb","ad80185a46b7b19a78d7243f00c07b76cd83f23b","eea9dd75261ddd7a0f047d0fe9d8749d769b6ce3","519fe1fd5ea17df71dc4b6427a3fe63043a95cf2","e390150559dc53be89bd34dd81d64572b149438c","151b97a8ab9b985ceb6127598447a8e0699a68e8","29d7f4c64184fae44172cef2c6e79abfd4be329b","3be98c1a641f9f62ca20826771dffe44cc4efab7","d0c0cabd169b164f0827d15bc294ad4a9f53dbbe","d0dacda2ee8307649ba31ed667251963b29c7284","82841e39ba95e4c1bf2f03d3613e4116663e1dfb","385d0403f7fabe27205842544c0410d88aa394fa","a1acbb487310f6270d0f6c3d6154fbc1f35cabd6","acdede88f2827a8aad5945538b30ad643170a6e8","28655fb756e0c67768ef0bb49ecb224ac7ec4d64","04da14b5f65ee75d9278e7bac33c5258eae3952f","231dd24b26722ec4ff80cbc8fea54388891bc389","263634b7f9dc119700a37ba79e78cfe10eb159b6","8e2d2238b94663fceee90e6c88aa03fd2f780c1c","7ef25fb68af6a37fc47fd8f236473354b5be0455","9470b438e6cd69fef8a8f5c2c24f92cf75946151","7ee9cb64e38ecf6a22e3bb2579268c05e4cd5045","2e695bb3ffc0486277e2e6182ff71fa9cb55e4cb","e2c6f7a4fb1db7613af71c2b00612ce552808d80","6e48e91978165d4d25e1f523056a8965339f3a3b","f5218512f7bedd470f0c936f5e813219df9252f6","e8e19cd41e6f8ee27b553b3fc938678b444eeaf4","957505ad83ef0b7f84845637cf0411e070d37410","4c4f6eacdf34faa9864d14875055913621e58894","e05af70aa326c6ad18db57a347fcaeeea98e5638","0044f7cd922dcf363c42029ecd27c13adb0baaf4","8f32a8b2f5a709a09f7cfc9e7a9e131cf07603b5","e4e03b1e83d209fe257a1a8dde95b266a40ef6a0","d8e05f1cf944b8db93bde3613d78d0712f240e27","dd38a94b875966077789cacbe9ae2a1c4fb0a5ae","f777a14a4fa27bc5d480661f0b7e3a9d1ff1d433","808aedcd087271bff0eb1757d24a9653cf5392dc","93b1cc9ecefb27783d4a0ecb90e3aa80b34b65da","c9e1af1362b266737e9d1bd42a5e1f6c7ffab0d4","0cf2e8e1862aa0310aaa9e2ce688c50c046337db","7ceaf17104f012f77cd48422989b378bdb022a90","878c4bf7649bd20a44e60707051f7a681a9a1e68","f2c676107f98df5d31923e2fca1e6d031265d677","5af309347a450b3e1319cab3b6512b42d77457f7","4ead826c66c2657a59f10718e4883961a32dc7ca","89624d086f1f761e8f974e41b09baae81b5a1b60","31a2106301f5fdb19f99a8d9be8516c2e26e0193","92d03b6fbe25bee56fdfb69a2296384cbbe5e9db","f2a5a2547cf81c0b727868092678929be00d4ee4","8d920dffe0643c5f4d8a562e89e40f6daf22275e","69c41bb31f39c4ec11e9931f0decc28800e320b7","7917467dc3341d9eafba03bae1f90b8843ba58c7","884ca69b44277effec184abb4daf3159f62bd9e2","8668d0ec289618406fab696db28fd412b2836a6f","707983553e9b9488d137322c9bf695749383d911","bedfa438ba932b0091a5275242962e23040c147d","962553735fd7f8036b59a8996baf3c436fa156ce","c5b9d4569dadb7c4a0f9ef9d9e67ae6b1006aa87"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/papers/83.83.pdf","http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/courses/dif8901/papers2003/P-r08-morisio00.pdf","https://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337186","http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","http://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf"],"title":"Investigating and improving a COTS-based software development","doi":"10.1145/337180.337186","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337186","venue":"ICSE"}

Therefore, in complicated engineering processes, engineers with different areas of expertise often find it difficult to access the same information in different domain-specific modeling environments. \n Our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the models as task-oriented spreadsheets, using a unified model (in UML or SysML) and a unified user interface (in the spreadsheet program). The formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks while the target models remain in a unified modeling language. Since the transformation between the spreadsheets and the models is automated and transparent, users do not have to be skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets. \n Using our novel approach, we were able to reduce the errors and time, and also the difficulty for each task without providing specialized training for the engineers. A preliminary user study showed that, by applying the spreadsheet-based approach, we could reduce the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering tasks.","inCitations":["36c1e5aa3aea47750b986e710b1a6be3682d7ae0","294125450397136c5daf03461e2bb3755d1d8009"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568231","http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/jp-E35063/main.pdf"],"title":"Controlled modeling environment using flexibly-formatted spreadsheets","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568231","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568231","venue":"ICSE"}

This way, the specification of structure is separated from data processing. The resulting architecture encourages customization and facilitates reuse. It enables faster development through a division of labour between investigators and software engineers.\n We have performed an initial evaluation of Derric by constructing a data recovery tool. This so-called carver has been automatically derived from a declarative description of the structure of JPEG files. We compare it to existing carvers, and show it to be in the same league both with respect to recovered evidence, and runtime performance.","inCitations":["9b2f29ac875900b632facf1e2391908a38cb2069","82ca7acda885ce0b12351dd4d4e3b9f33453f0c7","75e24111c704ad121d098f718dc8df4c9615f000"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tijs_Van_der_Storm/publication/221555820_Bringing_Domain-Specific_Languages_to_Digital_Forensics/links/09e4150981f70ac02c000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985887"],"title":"Bringing domain-specific languages to digital forensics","doi":"10.1145/1985793.1985887","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1985793.1985887","venue":"ICSE"}

Building upon existing software systems while maintaining or improving software quality is a major goal of software engineering. To achieve this, every software engineering phase (requirements analysis, software design, implementation, testing and maintenance) must produce good quality outputs for the next phase. We believe that a next generation reverse engineering tool can assist in realizing this need. Improving access to living, accurate knowledge is critical to the success of software development [3]. We believe that the next generation reverse engineering tool should allow architects and designers to ask their day-to-day questions directly to the tool and receive up-to-date answers while interacting with the tool. insight is a new and powerful CASE toolset for software developers and architects, designed to support the development and maintenance of software throughout the complete lifecycle. The insight tool suite provides software architects and developers with new capabilities of understanding existing software systems, allowing them to ask their day-to-day questions directly to the tool and receive up-to-date answers while interacting with the tool. It includes data mining capabilities such as code flow extraction, and software interaction extraction such as operating system and application specific messaging, uses, needs, etc. The insight tool suite also includes powerful graphical interfaces for presenting and manipulating the extracted information. Control flow is presented as editable flowcharts. insight supports Protel, ANSI C, and C++. insight uses a patent pending reverse engineering technique to perform these extractions. 2 REVERSE ENGINEERING insight offers a method and suite of software tools that automatically reverse engineers existing systems based on their structural and behavioral representation.

Analysis of problem reports generated by the integration and system testing of an embedded, safety-critical software system identified four common mechanisms for requirements discovery and resolution during testing: (1) Incomplete requirements, resolved by changes to the software, (2) Unexpected requirements interactions, resolved by changes to the operational procedures, (3) Requirements confusion by the testers, resolved by changes to the documentation, and (4) Requirements confusion by the testers, resolved by a determination that no change was needed. The experience reported here confirms that requirements discovery during testing is frequently due to communication difficulties and subtle interface issues. The results also suggest that \"false positive\" problem reports from testing (in which the software behaves correctly but unexpectedly) provide a rich source of requirements information that can be used to reduce operational anomalies in critical systems.","inCitations":["39094de1160fcbf65ed3dabb58c68ffc5e801553","165ee72226c44bcd22d1aa3b74cf5ae4b0e3474f","9852655f7deb220e2d3431d27bd511517d44d523","a8b8ad25296df8fc64191816d4f926c9339d0b44","c9e0aa71c931e2a02b09132223f2e9b6700e50b9","c77a50da969a61435bfe09543c19207a43e5d631","e2e5b808148e091652c84193cfd2cbae4225c85d","49df815e99bb7ccb41dd3b4043545031ccf7ea02","45d50609cfa61be09a0a3a06d8b4b53f5448e2c0","2d60bd6a1d4745f8686acd4b38be0229d58a5643","f1ec34bb74a304c3ed8fb7ead5221e0cec7499ce","3eaa88dc6831c349827ef76761f870b9fc5b8d54","1f42ae3f5c7322e268aa325bea911f246272a13e","5e2662b2c1ca1768b7691fdf36e1dab98323ed26","06a9ea63547b11865832c0dee25574dca8a6ae3f","3bcb9dbe710b79e4d7c4d65bd7ae6efb53a5cf7f","d2bf6dabf363e842c1d2384c40134b960b1b1c3d"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~rlutz/publications/ICSE03.pdf","http://www.ecs.csun.edu/~rlingard/COMP595VAV/p578-lutz.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776894","http://www.menzies.us/pdf/03lutzicse.pdf","http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~rlutz/publications/ICSE03.pdf"],"title":"Requirements Discovery during the Testing of Safety-Critical Software","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

This approach to software development makes the environment responsible for detecting most inconsistencies between software design, specifications, documentation, source code, and test cases. The environment provides facilities to ensure that these various dimensions remain consistent as the software is written and evolves. The environment works with the wide variety of artifacts typically associated with a large software system. It handles both the static and dynamic aspects of software. Moreover, it works incrementally so that consistency information is readily available to the developer as the system changes. The demonstration will show this environment and its capabilities.","inCitations":["0e3e098f5d40b10b09584c416036422fbe3d013b"],"pdfUrls":["http://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/pdfs/2003/Reiss-2003-CEC.pdf","http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/research/clime/demopaper.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776967","http://cs.brown.edu/people/spr/research/clime/demopaper.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Reiss/publication/221553427_CLIME_An_Environment_for_Constrained_Evolution_Demonstration_Description/links/02e7e51b614b868411000000.pdf"],"title":"CLIME: An Environment for Constrained Evolution Demonstration Description","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

However, raw traces tend to be too voluminous and too unstructured to be used directly for visualization and understanding. We address this problem in two phases: the first phase selects subsets of the data and then compacts it, while the second phase encodes the data in an attempt to infer its structure. Our major compaction/selection techniques include gprof-style N-depth call sequences, selection based on class, compaction based on time intervals, and encoding the whole execution as a directed acyclic graph.

Cherniavsky","ids":["2058166"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"The notion of formal validation of software has been taken by some to mean the mathematical proof of correctness of the software. Seldom is it argued that testing of software (except exhaustive testing) formally validates the correctness of the software. In fact it has become a truism in certain parts of the software engineering field that testing can “show the presence of bugs not their absence!” We argue that testing can do more. In certain circumstances a well chosen test set provides as much assurance that a program is correct with respect to a specification as does a formal proof of correctness. We look upon the act of testing as a process in which test data (input-output pairs) are chosen to distinguish correct programs from incorrect programs. As such it is complementary to the learning process in which input-output pairs are given and the task is to select the program which produced the pairs. In well studied cases in which the learning process succeeds, the testing process also succeeds. Success for both processes is relatived to classes of functions. For the learning process this means that there is a class F of functions such that after seeing sufficiently many pairs, the learning process chooses the unique function that produced the pairs. The testing process in this interpretation is the discovery of a function T that maps functions in F to finite initial segments such that each initial segment uniquely identifies that function (i.e., the initial segment differs from all but one function in F). We have identified several classes of admittedly simple functions that satisfy this definition and whose testing function T is easy to compute. These classes include pattern functions and finite state transducers and classes represented by sets closed under well-quasi orderings. We’ve also identified, recursion theoretically, classes of functions satisfying the above. The difficulties with applying the above are similar to difficulties encountered by other methods that just consider programs as computing functions. Since the functional view of programs is quite narrow (what function does a payroll program compute?), the validation techniques application is narrow. To use as a validation method one has to first identify F, then find T, and finally show that all the correct and incorrect nronrams compute functions that lie in the class F. If a program then satisfies its test set (i.e., the pairs of the test set agree with the input output pairs of the program on the finite initial segment), then the program is formally validated. Normally the above method requires that the set of correct and incorrect programs be testable for equivalence. For general purpose programs, such testing is impossible. For restricted languages, however, testing for equivalence may be easy.

It is based on the observation that students, in a typical software engineering course, gain little practical experience in issues regarding the software process. The underlying problem is time: any course faces the practical constraint of only being able to involve students in at most a few small software development projects. Problems and Programmers overcomes this limitation by providing a simulation of the software process. In playing the game, students become aware of not only general lessons, such as the fact that they must continuously make tradeoffs among multiple potential next steps, but also specific issues such as the fact that inspections improve the quality of code but delay its delivery time. We describe game play of Problems and Programmers, discuss its underlying design, and report on the results of a small experiment in which twenty-eight students played the game.","inCitations":["0dc41f38e2cb77595cd3dbc37ecd3374b17edb4d","8390d4f1e6b6e896f5f6fa78f98e413aefb0d0cf","82d5eb27e668a0d59fe3d9666fb9b3a8651e6319","7c9505b5db75ac7f23017ec47fcb49fcef79c267","3014171af39d53eaaa340cd01f41823f9a8a3532","9c815032324fe037109117582c7716e17fdf7102","d7f37063b049b9c10e6e36ebae5938b82b2ded11","ca233b43348b9a9634393eb0397720d0a0494d9a","4873f949594d436d01ef0f118f1826247c611174","2134c3114165adaf0de543af4cd8f272a52fecd5","3591b3941d3b1ede40eb8c26ddb5ab5f7d84a9ef","ec3a8a67a5d175347e287fb2b02901f79a58c731","af6013c855fcdba8f55163c1d6447de248c4d6f0","c2d92f66712c2fcea35c252cb3dd654eadd36853","996251f0823ee80e0d088a420934352f024ec02f","42426da97fcadd03e7a3462959393a4e08c45b8e","7424d9c29fb2c4f2716a72fc0eaf8a7e7201eb22","f6a1065edb85f304c51997103c0de6e402534ed0","1515506aa464b32e2cd928080cb8b1198918904f","56dbf59809efe0e8adceac3a6721385b9897d855","c1d3cd7339d4895d9af0b8fa82b7bcfcb518177c","ee4c67a692346f7138da3da13e84eab39293654d","4ed7fb6b5d7bf11dc4ef091dfe882a3cac7a30de","e50bd812a0d919ef48e84516187bd6c96aa86b6b","bc134beed9232238d10d991d2bd503da635e07fa","5ac6633afc7435da1b9eb9d033ff6123bafa66e2","e0507169f18060448d970fba9340717660481e00","c4cc63fce3c0644a351931119fe47366d1dca016","905b5205c4a19ea6cdb59bafa6850c00daae88bd","8a6b4b6e7c7adef8590ba490205318ea6d477fc1","05373cc4bae7e1bee8fe95789bd13e028878c0d8","850d3f4b39a0c8bfd3b60cc46f8cff4a4578e121","300931fff6abb38ea79c2124382864673ac1da18","0bc0e8a802a056bf14e6aa27c042c9dd239fcb66","54f152cef8d96f003455696b8c722bf57f0b820c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ics.uci.edu/~abaker/files/ICSE2003-2.pdf","https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~figueiredo/disciplinas/papers/icse03pnp.pdf","http://www.isr.uci.edu/~andre/papers/C26.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776901","http://www.isr.uci.edu/~andre/research/papers/ICSE2003-2.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~emilyo/papers/ICSE2003.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~andre/papers/C26.pdf"],"title":"Problems and Programmers: An Educational Software Engineering Card Game","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Although process improvement does not offer an order of magnitude improvement overnight, it does yield consistent results that accrue steadily over the long term. Software organizations in companies such as Hughes Aircraft, Motorola, Raytheon, Ericsson, and Boeing have undertaken serious software process improvement programs and reported between an average of 6 to 1 returns on their investment in improvement activities. This tutorial will describe the problems these programs are designed to solve. It will provide a brief overview of the Capability Maturity Model which has proven to be a successful improvement model. Methods for conducting successful process improvement programs will be described, and lessons learned horn several such programs will be shared. The tutorial will conclude with a description of the software productivity and quality benefits experienced in successful improvement programs. INTRODUCTION Like so many other industries before it, software development is evolving from a craft practiced by skilled artisans, into a professional discipline. Part of this transition is to adopt proven practices and tools that aid developers in performing and coordinating their work. The CMM was designed to help organizations work through this transition. The CMM’s development was a community effort involving more than 500 software developers and managers coordinated by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), a federally funded center of excellence established at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Over the last several years numerous case studies have emerged from organizations that achieved dramatic benefits from their software process improvement activities.

Edwards Deming, Philip Crosby, and others into a model that can be applied in software development. The CMM integrates principles from three different areas: total quality management, organizational change, and software engineering. The CMM helps organizations adopt improved development practices maturing it through 5 levels, each of which prepares it to adopt increasingly sophisticated practices (Figure 1). The CMM incorporates strong measurement and feedbaclc mechanisms to help an organization learn and improve from experience. In Level 1 organizations, software practices are ad hoc and are often reinvented on each project. Unreasonable schedule or resource commitments cause sound development practices to be sacrificed to schedule. Consequently, developers have little chance to improve their performance or pursue innovative ideas. In Level 2 organizations, managers begin building and tracking plans with achievable commitments that developers have participated in making, and establish control over requirements and product baselines. The objective of the Repeatable level is to provide developers with a stable environment in which to practice their profession. One of the first benefits organizations experience at the Repeatable level is a dramatic reduction in the number of projects missing scheduled deliveries. Organizations that achieve Defined (Level 3) experience at least a doubling of productivity compared to their performance at the Initial level. These gains result from adopting standard processes such as inspections that catch many defects shortly after they are made, rather thnn in the latter stages of testing where they can require 10 times the effort to correct. In addition, most organizations achieving the Defined level have reported that a strong professional culture developed around the organization’s standard software practices. Many organizations have set challenging quantitative goals for reducing project durations or defect","inCitations":["aab3b7e59b96508ae46f573680571e06d56ac5eb","5b15f93dd540b0109d388f2abd3f0bd2c155f8a1","934e14739d4efb92c503c8f3a5c1c3077b34bbc2","139b696519fd9472144c046b8ea694c2d02dd1b6","4a2367be82c9305964ddd4afa0e98582686e16e5"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/253228.253536"],"title":"Software Process Improvement: Methods and Lessons Learned (Tutorial)","doi":"10.1145/253228.253536","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/253228.253536","venue":"ICSE"}

Ultimately, such conceptual architectures must be cast into code. The iterative design inherent in interactive systems implies that significant evolution will take place at the conceptual level. Equally, however, evolution occurs at the implementation level in order to tune performance. This paper introduces Dragonfly, a software architecture style that maintains a tight, bidirectional link between conceptual and implementation software architectures, allowing evolution to be performed at either level. Dragonfly has been implemented in the Java-based TeleComputing Developer (TCD) toolkit.","inCitations":["f402ff1355812a7c28fe54b1c2f0081a5365200c","f37168cd22d170c997a0f4c6a75ba4efa208da8d","0ca8774a89ca0c62505eea356218324d73dec5eb","b09f22c0fb8f0129efef5bc7088af802e3b3ccbd","76e9ccedbe826d6902710984e7eb61bab12cfc84","1ecfcc9bf20e523820ab6b874b972d5b2b562edf","882eb8d1c694a91a1a65a17cb847d7dc78af9805","53ec3aa93ea5a05e93762d96d1d9775eb8150fbe","821164d4a6dd7c5ee0aee4e12f8bf854d7f83ebd","315dc6db97897bb9ff9e36357018bdf2e5e6924d","3691cdc1d195d0c971d73fcd5c3bbef7fc9c8415","fbaeea1432371d4e52666a84a39397147812640e","b1f2640d0fe3e6c968d79cce9926e7e285413daa","5bbd7ffd609d459fd4a9025e39c1a8c308433e93","7f4db446013cc5ddefca2db856539f886c7e7e21","d8eef40f18dccb8d44c62a981bbaf8b9a0ae2ddb","26792c7369493318ded7b7c6f591952acf115b0f","c723a4b3e60c79ad18ab3efc73fef8384d89c8c8","80f37163fd3929a237fb738edde733b935029487","10a806eabdabf6a8d21d2f807e83b2a685acfd65"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337208","http://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~graham/stl/pubs/AndersonGrahamWright-Dragonfly-ICSE2000.pdf","http://stl.cs.queensu.ca/~graham/stl/pubs/AndersonGrahamWright-Dragonfly-ICSE2000.pdf","http://dundee.cs.queensu.ca/~graham/stl/pubs/AndersonGrahamWright-Dragonfly-ICSE2000.pdf","http://equis.cs.queensu.ca/~equis/pubs/2000/anderson-ICSE-00.pdf"],"title":"Dragonfly: linking conceptual and implementation architectures of multiuser interactive systems","doi":"10.1145/337180.337208","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337208","venue":"ICSE"}

As software quality management and quality assurance must be carefully integrated into existing company processes or business cultures, we had to substantially adapt the review process to the specific needs of the above project and its context characteristics. The chief difference to the traditional procedure for conducting reviews as, for example, set out in [1] or [2] is that our review process has a strong workshop character with an emphasis on one of the most crucial success factors for reviews: sufficient time for the individual preparation of the reviewers. We also describe the phase of analyzing the effort and defect data captured with respect to cost benefit aspects and the quality of the reviewed documents in relation to each other.","inCitations":["e25f6ae6f8e6013c02ac9fbce4dde74eb362ca69","91b2e86c971a9242a84db8da1cd0332141051eae","6789fe4a27eef636e944cafd819592f6a3ff8880","8b16a9b1eb45ffb5bb8fa3cdd52c9e7d679d2cd0"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776880"],"title":"Experiences on Defining and Evaluating an Adapted Review Process","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether practitioners in the industry also share this perception. This paper describes the outcome of an exploratory study in which 26 industrial practitioners were interviewed on what makes a software system a legacy system, what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems, and what challenges are faced during the modernization process. The findings of the interviews have been validated by means of a survey with 198 respondents. The results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly, the challenges they face are not just technical, but also include business and organizational aspects.","inCitations":["6a4569fed798c8ba1567a27bbf020340f5e4c571","f58cc42b995030849dcf2c8e181437e50ecc4532","23f83ebb8a95a8f92ea9c9e3d408aafc2e8d88c2","a37c89641addae5d7d4c49b20a9eac9bf96e4e60","32101d878314dd49a37790b25a459fb07eb3de39","3d69104c2026c4d66667d957fc42c7fbffa3e183","2a6506bbe89e43144faa913a82637a48cc4f281b","150a682001684bf7197a3db4906974d67f025d57","dac0e5aca8c756b20ecd3299d2191d5d5095a24c","da78c479a1cb8544eb8e687c2ed4ca33c9b028a6","e05b7447db090e61cf27fbc8832937620a90a7cc","9d4b4e73ed7ee6efc9ecc51df414e1e8d27aba92","3bdc63f5c4601805124801236eff9057ef199f15","a86134724e8dbb490f7cfde5ba1aaf5b813a1973","87a753a17aa7781f0b7dcbcbbc7adee805d0f189","f24dcb993648203510ebe7a31f9d0fa330c33d28","a6d06a5c68dd673abd012306550aaf6d78bdfb40","687f1689c9f9654d69c56e946936133ee16c3b84"],"pdfUrls":["https://servicifi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/icse.pdf","http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~khadk101/publication/CR_ICSE.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568318","https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~khadk101/publication/CR_ICSE.pdf","https://slingerjansen.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/icse14main-p461-p-23497-a09af2f-21014m-final.pdf","http://qwik.jp/se-reading/10.files/A4.pdf"],"title":"How do professionals perceive legacy systems and software modernization?","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568318","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568318","venue":"ICSE"}

Prototyping, beta testing, and usability testing are widely used to refine system requirements, detect anomalous or unexpected system and user behavior, and to evaluate software usefulness and usability. The World Wide Web enables cheap, rapid, and large-scale distribution of software for evaluation purposes. However, current techniques for collecting usage data have not kept pace with the opportunities presented by Web-based deployment. This paper presents an approach and prototype system that makes large-scale collection of usage data over the Internet a practical possibility. A general framework for comparing software monitoring systems is presented and used to compare the proposed approach to existing techniques.","inCitations":["ee419c6c60d384b58481cc58181f401477696ae1","2443c4f1424933852c8c6fdc7e78171a6a399f82","0acae04b32b5b2fde969d69d52579b24b6a87104","26cf8005b7d29a13a81dbe98cc4544bb9971eede","01878ab1be50f3239d649b8c9618ddd5f68dc484","c7fb042baa629ca5d868d7cb15ee6d40809b81b8","735c50d698143083b621451137554ee8222547dc","062bdfc36db140a507395a68dd0d39a3763c0aa7","938f7ec12de5df340cfe1ce41b32a55ba7e17335","89dc7034d6c1f1fddb82224018e3e71b763d2fd2","9d6705b0312fd9540f245e4bab059bfcdb252874","0b5c56745de1ce761e602388a6d30419b42ec818","4fb2d7719b217140a96db09de28eec2cc64adbad","05f8392c0af3af1f0a546fa5d10441f70684fcf6","3fd8f4696aa9d4b629c8ac85c0f9e306ec957d48","7b15d5d500e71276387b44ed5be660234093f70e","19c97d8a46fa10e37020c3b325c97ac23113cffb","50d40edb65336da6cb32bd568f71465d4e31b7a3","4c46c07b821772b680dc7cb3bafeb6646041062b","2556b06fbadc5aec092b3f6259a038a57d8512bb","0f635999fcab53d64a1e98e44c76bb1343b818cf","aaec9cde9fcee5de073e6683703c0d140bc99c20","42a4c2b927df2db151a51779f8abc8e2476d7e36","75e2bb5115b42cafc365e284e2c20ba7daf4c3af","50defb887805fb136841f7d536942749ade4390f","3bc93e556684b7802d822e3baf38e83d9677c04b","288b1d1dcc810578943c712ba1e5354071d2ba48","a7237a62d1b382edff80d7f9a71a5f64b568424c","b703b74ad4631229ded447647f0b1420c65363c2","905f23794fc369fb5a929cd25c125d987ce2dda1","294af1984593cb436f35ba713a4f11e97690558d","779ceea17ddd7221f875c644ec05df9cb4812996","85facae8f56802dbe543396dae5793b4d454c477","22da55a4ab766a5cbfb6fa73f6260a4a036dda28","621b31275b2d67ac954f9ac81ed53f1a198e5fe0","0aa4aeb2034056accb6e7072c5423aac525a3146","241ac955a02eb44baf180d821dfd0427e13f34de","93ad0277ef138d0f46d5928a44e41de8941b4b38","07455b2499a282489fcbf88e239fb15c9fb093a6","1269bbc81fedebfb4d884b5f9c1f64a5e58350b1","d5e0f53756017276667267e5d36db887fb8c4369","3582cedd0624fafbaede843fb5c8a1603c54028b","a3acbfb689b66bb8ce30a0f4d80274989fc8b0f4","655ed3f17f50cdd413363e310f4c3c78c7afd18b","122dd51acee4396daae0ba1a241adf079e211eb6","0d81b6a8667cfd12a387f65c073ab28a6a2e77f2","1bd5b801489eee65e6e7974c4850941798d9464f","068628cdbfe278077851d6a91a8dbbe03abcf3fe","a2b55650e57c6d57cab0fdd7b7d649ec032915a9","59f332c64e0f25c8a1ed978d351a8a3ebef3de7d","9e45af742c6c2701ea2045dc4892f96af01ed939","aab5bf09dfb09b8c46e2bcd9c1d0cb2def525ef6","0e934c6b7c75cb35258d7b7859c8f92726a1d2ba","151b02b7a06d2e91b610bb38aa364977fe415421","c0246e83713689688aaa2c9985837380a95aefc4","15296d03be203603cb02b994a34c18d8078a7290","1d737920e815b2eed4ff8f90d0c615c269fab3cf","07fa1248aba1a43a21a11fabb60e6f0c1c71f6a4","36088e5dac398536263ae1c89fb36c50a70ffd8a","315d25d865bf16fc3ac58b894d412a8bb123ad7a","7baaf74f0814312ddd10fca45739dda921d084aa","09ab8eeec59c720d6ac9875347f93168e4fa8d9d","ae558f1d2aa8c19074231ed1dd7c80760493f87d","975a3fe3a77169d94d38d63af11bfd024c837389","f2e6f3f552ec68313fdd305acf464eb717a6df7d","aab10c956985a0f976bd127ae5d1596309767a94","0f9cd62f8587f35f79bf7a6de134d2104f4a2d6a","76b4f7693486553f8fff0ffe90fc9d7c51ae1d9a","32e8e8ac4e366b6ea002fa81ed6b4f459b640c27"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dhilbert/papers/EDEM-UCI-ICS-97-40.ps","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/papers/icse98-EDEM/final.pdf","https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2004/cmsc838p/Remote/EDEM-ICSE98.pdf","http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/eden/papers/reports/1997/ics9740.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/papers/icse98-EDEM/final.ps","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671110","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/publications/C012-GRS94.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/eden/papers/conferences/1998/icse/icse98.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/eden/papers/reports/1997/ics9740.pdf","http://www.fxpal.com/people/andreasg/kbse94.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dhilbert/papers/EDEM-ICSE98.pdf","http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/eden/papers/conferences/1998/icse/icse98.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/papers/kbse94/final.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics221-FQ03/papers/HR98.pdf","http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/publications/C025-HR98.pdf"],"title":"An Approach to Large-Scale Collection of Application Usage Data Over the Internet","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671110","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671110","venue":"ICSE"}

One of the most challenging-and often most neglected-problems in CBSE for enterprise DRE systems is the system (re)deployment and (re)configuration (D&C) process, where the increasing heterogeneity and versatility of application domains requires supports for an unprecedented level of configurability and adaptability. Existing D&C technologies suffer from two major problems: (1) insufficient module-level reusability and ability to evolve in the face of functionality evolution and diversification due to the interaction of too many orthogonal concerns imposed by a wide range of application requirements and (2) significant inherent and accidental complexities stemming from inadequate design tools. To address these problems, my research focuses on improving both computing performance and human productivity associated with the D&C of component-based enterprise DRE systems. To improve computing performance, my research has systematically identified bottlenecks with conventional D&C approaches and provides an aspect-oriented approach to decouple \"extrinsic\" orthogonal D&C concerns from \"intrinsic\" core D&C infrastructure, thereby enabling different crosscutting D&C concerns to be weaved independently to create a light-weight, highly optimized and extensible D&C infrastructure. To improve human performance, my research provides model-driven tools and analysis techniques to alleviate key inherent and accidental complexities in the D&C process.","inCitations":["ab5b2f75a9d88a055420da8f736e50e517006f50","cc106b341e58b4386b88ee2662d080f624762ec9","1c997100c1be61c260219d67d54e073e878384b3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134459"],"title":"Resolving component deployment & configuration challenges for enterprise DRE systems via frameworks & generative techniques","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134459","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134459","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper reports the initial results of this work; it describes our PMDB model and discusses some of the technical issues in the definition and design of an environment database.","inCitations":["b05aed2e59505f6b5bab837c4e1d083eb83b348d","b9f3b820cf9fdc53b9956e941bdfb007dbcc6d88","ba897deb1856ae7d017c55ed74471281e0978c6c","f1d64cc36d4cb51f0419c7ccc0e4a43e8a82c13c","df94a5e80c148eeb98603f25309aa7bf508c3cb6","481150f022fda023cbd58aecc5f2473c6e6139ac","28cde8e63e333d942e6e8d60e8bd19d46864c54c","e9f9d6f270941323c2a3632725b600746254c2d3","85708a7fbdf630dee6a272b4ff28ae90f066cc69","a1ba194697b1d6d5f2b34df27f390002591a4c3a","0005dcc0d9da6b4ebd597dc5e207a5b36028e4c6","150fde2f71e1a8fca2323e216193b21dc49ea7a4","9006fe30e0e4072924a8ef8ab78e7d7f75446cdf","05043fcb052ba61933f926c33b7db2d2dfbf2ed2","79172a9adbf9567467cca58026e0e2ba9ef74e28","5e8ff8b3fe56d319e3fe8c9a38fb59af776df46e","741cff98fc4c423c27456f6e04db8a8da629af11","551f6b285d404e07f63bdba9beb8e2fcc88dfbe7","969a874ad2a1b8c6382c98f7725ad0d1b3267349","1420c16210a261f364020390dff475d668291fe3","460cc30803b9a8f2fef9a51eb38b49cb96a46918","a9caedb40e56f1a3ecc17885c87188a060ba2f47","8be46766cd4ca0f999709e5e48824d83abae7462","3adcf7882e0110e9d37c0d12cd380dea3b47d4e2","f5704786646e3c0d4a0fcbb0ca88bd6deeb11167","2fb820c29f2369c3057190791c839d00c013ce25","5c418dcba8912a8381acaf56badd247a5539b32b","cb90a1a055c2f25a82301dad6cdf7d713666f070","251696534af02dd7671ef3cb2957f9c7da3f43e2","1ddfd5bd171c9cbecee967f7a0c35a3992513fab","9aed2e020e21b32fc172b95599b4e95663612950","c6b4f184624dfd4c873007210b9011e7b286e904","0183dea929b2c9b51aca9c0d9364da24a869fd5e","13b3b1673ab207e50df0d59e992d248c53e27dc1","d580565963c0a9134850c4cd744e840c17957ae2","a14282fb4faa9913620f72d4517c7799281bf6b0"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319608"],"title":"PMDB - A Project Master Database for Software Engineering Environments","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

A report that appears in this repository must be triaged to determine if the report is one which requires attention and if it is, which developer will be assigned the responsibility of resolving the report. Large open-source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository. The thesis of this work is that the task of triage can be eased by using a semi-automated approach to assign bug reports to developers. The approach consists of constructing a recommender for bug assignments; examined are both a range of algorithms that can be used and the various kinds of information provided to the algorithms. The proposed work seeks to determine through human experimentation a sufficient level of precision for the recommendations, and to analytically determine the trade-offs of the various algorithmic and information choices.","inCitations":["44e06fb03b90fe2c3160a20d54631902eda50d59","88997c8b7daa74cd822d82bf33581c8fa966a347","fe733e8a71fae0d2a4fea0b7292fdf86aec0cf1b","79363fb1b65cc23bbe4d317e4548e4a439f8c654","abeee0e5422dedf269ca48144bb6515e6b86be4e","461372583929930911c6b3326bb3793eee20263b","518e5836c237887aff2db2fa514c1dddf86370bf","fdbcd40584df0cddca59ef540ee545ff5070d19a","ac292ffd5b1095c43b03688b9ca26bb2b65cf24b","cfbeae943ecd6700246ce717fb0ebfda2079d297","520ba085756492bbd45361fc0d87bf396eef5134","5d1ecf78392e60a5a050c4151d88c03c0a825f69","2ebc4bdf8381a1a59b5d8f47dcdb6877f96c0315","c52d7d8a3f7079001733039d7b8bced8e387e1da","0f1c46ca3d7901419db635c8a54972729b3758d5","b7459b7205b122b42becc204613c83a37dc2b67e","b3c30cc756577374d8a813e2f002d66858a3b123","98600782d7cf977f5e2b0aa129d5674b5e323a82","dfb7a104b74d5d7584670098d0398594370ba1e5","83aa6f19894dba0b1251d8f89c0eb6e1629597c5","9888a98d8071c6825d23cc8848d4eec9a8ea0112","b87308c35b063c6eeaad5174bc166397ce6b2ce9","2c279e9ec03aff56f6c996674bd0d30299896e7e","67258a2679601d2cc69e533c49fcfd6366d7315e","3457d055b6505bd5b965fe0f0c62433cbb1945bd","32b35e7cc5879b3a8d6361da844d9a8978f29f88","ac4d8f0c6b3e7659efc15f658e9022b470518210","9b4df30d4019ad196ca0d5c34b8ef6ae5e5fc7ca","a294b33d17e3dffece0008fc9375a5036097c85c","5bd0dbc55618f0fa594633b90bdcbf3427c10f53","665607f1f968b82015d568baccb3f672e5158b3b","b2f81968067997eaf0c227632098cae9d19813c0","33ff70192cc5fb10893a94b28951afbf8cc13d02","028a58baa7db676ac5d7fb74d80e9b0a85ce28b8","229ecccf0865098fbce1a48731d7e3170398f2fb","32a47b9f3fc790b0b5d41c38937c775e85ab348f","8e6430426c0e33a5ce30d1aecb00ced5e746986c","29181f7bd7a5b182dbe443634e64632ce3167de6","a363786cb13a911cf76450aed58fb06c7d618268","fc6eedc69f5da8fa7f1b2aeae58c403c0c4746f3","4a412a08a520524a2550840efdcf3861e2a16c4e","86730119e858a43882ccca8b0bca65b343392b2d","8c67fa7a1cd2a7dee718612d50f44c5dc35465ab","59d92dcf12bed930745862738a2135cc1f3bd32f","19550c426dd565c86d1bc9494bf7a5357cbf09e7","d2ec227b3b236b268f36238c98f97f49b8e17345","f9d2b1daf814daf3414e61efa8eed41ec4a04bf4","8db634cabf0917979729927acf0016369930575a","9341b6584658d5a50ebaf1bc96b29dc2e1bd9d14","059b58717018886e895ad690dea3d49579d4a1c1","d4101041380bf5a7c76b373d55e691f4f73c73c1","9d51f250460a2d7ef7075323512fd022750800d3","726cb75a8a10b915f463cb45a6dbaf266eabf7b4","e1a3a90c7544741113e64b5c5ae9823a1476426b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Anvik/publication/221553945_Automating_bug_report_assignment/links/02e7e51e4294606a0a000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134457","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p937.pdf"],"title":"Automating bug report assignment","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134457","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134457","venue":"ICSE"}

The key to the software re-engineering activity is the ability to recover (re-engineer) “lost” or otherwise unavailable information concerning specification and system design decisions from the information available in the existing system source code. Subsequently, a forward engineering step may reimplement and possibly upgrade the existing systems. This paper describes the underlying principles of a knowledge-based Software Re-engineering Environment (SRE) which is intended to provide high-level support to various software maintenance and re-engineering activities. existing systems in relatively good shape. At the same time, a large number of organizations have become critically dependent on the “good health” of those aging systems. Consider, for example, that every state government must maintain a vehicle and driver’s license registration system that operates around the clock and is used by a number of public and private agencies. Suppose that some of these systems were written years ago and have almost reached their capacity limits. Yet they must work, regardless of how much it costs to maintain them. The above situation describes what is usually referred to as software maintenance crisis. Introduction The main subject of this paper is attacking the difficult problem of re-engineering complex software systems. In particular, we describe a Software Re-engineering Environment (SRE), an intelligent software tool under development at Arthur Andersen and Co. to support the software re-engineering process. Real world business information systems, Transaction Systems (TS) in particular, are very expensive to maintain. As soon as they are delivered into so-called production, they start going through the continuous process of evolution and modification, This process is dictated by changes to the system environment and/or user requirements. In the next section of this paper, we take a closer look at the software re-engineering issues from the standpoint of system maintainer. Then, we will describe the architecture of SRE and some of its desired functionalities. In addition, we will address system abstraction and understanding, the critical issue in any re-engineering activity. And finally, the current state of SRE implementation and its future capabilities will be described. The system re-engineering activities may vary in type and scope. They may be corrective, enhancing, adaptive, perfective, or pro-active ([COLL86]). Their scope may range from error correction (system debugging), through program optimization, restructuring, addition or modification of functionality, all the way to system migration (e.g. to a new software/hardware platform) or renovation. Issues In Software Re-engineering Put aside the extreme cases of system migration and total renovationl, the rest is simply known as system software maintenance. Although different estimates are circulating among the field practitioners, between 50 and 70% of their time is now spent on keeping the A large TS system contains a, complex body of application programs, persistent data elements, and user procedures, all functioning in a given system hardware/software environment. As software engineers, we tend to think of these as the products of a forward engineering process the process of developing a TS from specifications.

As a matter of fact, both cases should be looked upon as a sequence of smaller and localized system changes used to manage the system migration/renovation risk. 01989 ACM 0270-5257/89/0500/0113$00.75 113 Recommended by: Manny Lehman Re-engineering those systems, however, is different. The latter process must contain an element of recouering the system design (usually not for the whole system but some parts of it) and/or its specification. Unfortunately the system specification and design documentation may be neither complete, reliable, nor even available. The only reliable source of system information is the system itself, its code as the lowest level of the system definition and the system interfaces as the best running model of system behavior. The typical situation in which system maintainers find themselves is illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure shows the professional skills groups involved in the development and maintenance of a system. In the forward engineering pass, the users state their system requirements in a problem domain-specific language. These requirements are analyzed by system specifiers ( who are usually referred to as systems analysts) and described in a domain independent language. The translation of domain-specific user statements into domainindependent system specification is critically contingent on human creativity.","inCitations":["212f567fa16820ae9132b8b1e8d317abbc8a2ab6","2ad92c4eae538e0a8027e872c56c50e38b7a3a4c","4f963c7c91bff50aa4a4b15cc2f7000c50804611","fed20d02dc1f995f995244b7bddf1b1f272da7c4","d4c45c50d532ebdcb657a93ea0440a57f8a1933f","0b5395dad331e6f74f34a8608dd8c855237166ac","698ace4a3b9b529f78eb50c5bb5b06ab27c7ff1a","bf330a4f6dd158b84a89e7f240f495af1fbe8cf6","7177f95a015dd1dd9e0466b498a87df68d60baa9","0a2da007697dac3dd2dffacd6c60899cbe00d704","44374e3ec6a08914c8b4cbbcf32bd63e0c14f6c5","e7c737e2eebbc86a1cb68d93b9a5a9b7422fae5b","3e7588fd57bb513d8ecb8f1efe95eb518c8c89ae","11d399be53b51be17f49b562a2e3d875b3b884ce","b4fb2437d4aa119be43961a0d1e90e7537d56e49","e1ff4c3c5f04d05de66591ad81fa469375ccc5e5"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74603"],"title":"SRE: A Knowledge-Based Environment for Large-Scale Software Re-Engineering Activities","doi":"10.1145/74587.74603","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74603","venue":"ICSE"}

This task is quite difficult as the added value is influenced by many drivers.

A framework (RMF) for requirements models is presented and its main features are illustrated. RMF allows information about three types of conceptual entities (objects, activities, and assertions) to be recorded uniformly using the notion of properties. By grouping all entities into classes or metaclasses, and by organizing classes into generalization (specialization) hierarchies, RMF supports three abstraction principles (classification, aggregation, and generalization) which appear to be of universal importance in the development and organization of complex descriptions. Finally, by providing a mathematical model underlying our terminology, we achieve both unambiguity and the potential to verify consistency of the model.","inCitations":["8c1f1e8741787acb087b89ec3cab2ab47acea41a","b12bd1f5a15c4c128e37323e9138c9ea4a1ca3a8","5746a4857471e20f3a22388fd0ff591156937ddb","19c53434322b75c7f7a0f9d6a68d800e0dcb30dc","ffd911204f8cb2bf65398e2ad48d48531b45b552","513cfb62a75cf1008fdfb4c63b5e40802bf88726","8cabc8e841e8d4dbcebbd6d93757b1f804bd4b24","841ef62132096212ade66b17d080030a8ca978c7","c30a4929f522ddf4a28bc15407b061078f498fc4","5a30fd3718835c500d1833492d6cd833c959d155","9eeefb84a21a45ca22dcbeb22f59287cf81c72d3","5ecfcd2f23c089fb32f7ef315668cd6c3b35ee37","a13ab04615ef9fba8e4e63cfb1de66e316fb9d4a","cfb710ef6a91f32ab47f0fe47816627eafc217a8","131700902458b0a1a5c5e3a33e4deb22f5eceb86","c448cca241d5d347d09fe67a03166b2b2aac89d4","c1c7182a56642cd026dd22d6b40173234a413ac7","34d7091f1e57aad4b23b1bbe4ba21b3547c0263c","05cecf7c3b536b0f8c4580d7ea0fbd750358fb5b","1a118c501eeef9722de71a7fc37423d09a863967","799169e956f803c4f26c923107abcc9453835bff","7253fdd06b76f365882a621ecbe76d9de8636da1","7d434dee950ff6509334b08df7052b371b7928e4","4bc3bc2d66b1d258f1b5927c50db100c2cb3e1ce","dc98dba39f0b7430bbc8ac7d5755f43b61c3ba59","0815a5a604d6aaf371eca36dd216a027d1f03d7b","e6d55da333acc99b6206cc35214f8a4bb3955480","6ae4a1ab483fb651dee757fbfc1391c05f671843","a7d81abd4b69017fd20efa1f04ab14cd198fa16f","63b9d2ca0a7813f751a73627108a40fd8ad98729","907e84fcd6381c68e242c352c64254c57994ef42","b10a77510d8651c0423051a4c4fc4476a1cf4b58","1e813b4931114bdad9eec85651d9decccb5f510b","810988c0a4850a3dfe3f2e5fd84ee5d3a0f34d7c","6e469affd99868a77a5fa8d42daa88a5a5416311","04561a909239fae2be0d13d4e296fee02262a5a0","61362c03bca581125a3c333d32e98c5bd8c01de2","970c216b842892a0dc8122d1ae9b23d70762ce12","e62cbd12e4a14d1aeb9ca8037b62cb20274e7589","77e25f58f0bcb510efefa2f89c5dcb003ab828c0","06d5c142264af14c455f341ca813edba85a735ca","13aa6684c61c3a9c43562fa1e9ed854df264e446","74f3abd07e8aad1c259b1582be9e142354828995","147966631214260eb4b9f02ff81539ca3ebd7d54","0a418fe372d44c56de9a3803e4583bcbf72864d0","0ab5081f2f7c096d96b634b0aae29fdb16ad3d41","be068938d8d643e8f2ef42d82d3343898b558d9d","c7fdd630db0794a832e99285f21ad09501db331e","90af015dcb5acad38b94da2fd66199422ef0983a","e84aa9950d22d3d47f9abd46f76d62dbe2d0da7a","830e350935cce3fa36998d3a8dc30328a0fa4786","44df9597eb9db6a2eb53316a41c8ff040fde71bf","4429df23d71e808275abed829b048c91594db2bf","d336331b066a3927508b084db194936e57b55058","0bbeacb6942cb677f1dfd47de3ac5f500a2de21b","b65719f65800433eb45477b3541d265603aee7ce","08f7fdd59529a2d6cc0f4aac8294ec700126cf5e","56dc3711469ae0b811aecc6e1b0101b5761073e2","a11f11d3c692aeab0e5fa8e7899970b9805b779a","9f4dae2f6c166259d53f2bdc3cac5b99af6c6aa8","e86871bb0dafbb1e3433f0802b9655b1a5cad0b8","09e507c14e02e9e025e572812126f23f2945cdcc","f1140c42e7883f925f7f0013292754d4d306500c","ce4e87767eb48392123bb1c785a5cd6acf06c732","6ffeae20e606b9e0f904eb77190ba3842f311101","18f07552790e6275229e20542f3c1f27e2487e41","27fd3659414ae23c093ef709a27fba28638100cb","63b6df63586863c9e92f1f0265167640e2dff46b","04f3bfc9fde3377d27667365494842a2c6697ae7","54ca4f816700f3ea804dadf40eedcbb4787a346e","57c2aa8847af36063ca956215687ec6890d7529e","12d07251ef3ea5d7e97f304392a539d05563f5f3","fcd84b7424336fa658057e5ae5182643ce02dc09","7f1484110988699f38dd32c80634cd2b29114eb0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jm/2507S/Readings/ICSE82.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jm/Pub/ICSE82.pdf","http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~yaoguo/PhDReading07/greenspan-icse6.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807765"],"title":"Capturing More World Knowledge in the Requirements Specification","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Cohesion is a quality that describes the degree to which the different actions performed by a module contribute to a unified function. However, this technique may be difficult to apply due to the subjective nature of the definitions of levels of cohesion. In this paper a software metric is defined and proposed as a discriminant for classifying modules according to their cohesion. Formal properties of the metric are derived which can be used to set the metric value ranges for module classification.","inCitations":["0aa6b3adbbf78e6701476309265ffb0e6c26076c","8a1370ac8f589fc4cb43b1b4314887506a974840","892dc591ddbb1d6419166a41db5412fed69a8082","da8fbf0475a88b5221c28719d20723c5e4a4562d","49c3737c3665d46fa97cef0451c275f15800b308","6553d6e1341f361035ab8fcb79920f9f31455b00","302bb0070aedcf647f770bf74c37291c156fb128","b329b569efec787828cc3ba4c51e97d9004d6f0d","64a576f797aa9222a66cd57de41855d2a9beae59","1b28df725f024ac81526441de95a2e9ba93f4843","f148474405f08760453ac6361e361d7775dc93ab","4f32ea374e514d681f221111789e26947331e7c8","fd02ea328823cc3bb2ac85e068442b861453fc1a","9f756b86b95ebd87a1d4338d21e417915a738f7a","c5a25882d9b76bbfc318023088199bf38b91652a","36e9e1f72d9959b1771ac540d379fa98e9218fe3","de3fc2684963a3f40c502baf43be3a9bd445d624","dbb77fa3bb6e1e9f644389d346d79260a8e38715","5bcb8d42af4a82d140d867d949e0eb08c84527c7","ca6a97ddd5bc8c08d29245dba77935be6521ad63","b454e6cdd7fa8b794253a6bd93981e626f023e8c","3b1858ed6012e37a9c84b66a38602c58ca1863e6","934246669088c0d5d0007db52b61a1dc85e0db05","84f76392e7df9c3abf93a3557556c58cfe9abc12","37f04e6c39f22ce186439a74e0583a55a732f810","8cae020c42375c6048e4b33bccfe90d45071159c","1bc1cd91f2b7afa199918a1ec17ce051086f6741","28fecea3023292b9c4d9c3a597dc988097727798","6a851298ffb9283a632a1fae1db625cc8d109792","068e7c40bcfc54ee1602579a892d826c0a330a3f","92dfd2560398adc0c6bbd3dced9c23113cf0f9bb","482dd72ce24ec08528bd97cbbe93d239a377fb0a","56ef126ef81b62096dcf8c1eccc89bd14fe32ee7","01f020debb152a332dca764e3e56c7fbe8b848af","545caba9cf65b5a4248d980eed0fceeb962f86ce","013a10c744d3a0402882b38f7b6fdfbbf28fced6","906bf1b74806172939af7b285baecf80265cc56f","ea9725bee0e9126ab76ac07cec24c70d2adccc71","bc1f05ba92194d38e00f47c35d3c64f16b5958d4","36a464e60ef5c64ef019d6bc9c98204ba981661f","370fe3ad888df6ed056703b26542e64e7d2b8761","246f5bab438cb9b0fc2f7920e0b737a67a995293","0917e841369f6668f9f24330914784049b569574","d677c4620a8b2ec093ce6c01ff64f1f64a811535"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801984"],"title":"A Discriminant Metric for Module Cohersion","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The cost-effectiveness of regression testing techniques varies with characteristics of test suites. One such characteristic, test suite granularity, involves the way in which test inputs are grouped into test cases within a test suite. Various cost-benefits tradeoffs have been attributed to choices of test suite granularity, but almost no research has formally examined these tradeoffs. To address this lack, we conducted several controlled experiments, examining the effects of test suite granularity on the costs and benefits of several regression testing methodologies across six releases of two non-trivial software systems. Our results expose essential tradeoffs to consider when designing test suites for use in regression testing evolving systems.","inCitations":["9105995d33d7d6e7a8f18743b12a8cae033d8405","ba525c0cc0909fb3554f61c1f695a76527b006ae","5a9234e2c186278ac081d2c3b3b658e5fcfa930d","c6f456b9efc7db477f200fd1806742e8b9ec9bf0","2bdd5eabda4cf611c38e2463cdf75d4725c1b7d2","82163e94f0bcb95dfc93a18799ea5d4fdd522caa","756899d59aa999fb40da6fde9f6f81d05369542c","2bcc3ebe33c1ebdfae36792b6399bf448a88f16c","951e62753a97861fd3baa5215f4750cc93474413","7a263bb73e5ba3ff9433ae67ace4987e472fe0d4","137539b6a564174348192e5baa2cddcab8a144ef","23dcca4eb2078b589e27e8091f0a06d18ce74915","33c624e34cf7929e72dd48f30d825d9a5fd9cba2","6ebc45e1ecd0fe4e07f93680dc000f91f7de74b6","2bb9a73121b0039bc55ea3c95d443c042c4b2af6","3e443b8a7b139ff982adfdbcb67ef5ff3a0ade16","710fcb921a7ff6ad6e2644e4665b39924ab1ff64","4382123c2629a2436a3d0de13fd4c69adaf0f06e","7453c6d6d8ca1faf9938c0a1dd26ce55253218c7","01d71ba1f3c5b11f713e44ecb9c0b36e4a5c83c2","1679f137707d6716f1b788dd01a7caef4f6d5474","132fba579baccfbe0b24812a5c6211d551319696","0214307ac5be9f37a1d09dbda93ceb25acee13c7","d09b95328ff2568c8cdb929abbaf010caca857ed","e38bbd6b55189db024d20622be8d814fd718eacb","5fe53428a761ce67786defdda3aed8fa5d47d09f","853d5e6ac57fc0d2b6ce5ba93d99a7ac6f27b144","371a5d5d1dbe38fdbd32600c95c09f24ab715e6f","15a60ffd7177c4385f4c00bfe460371901476ff9","9cc6cb3ba9cb80a7a211194ef5ded4c1def7d6fd","0cd7cd17dbec857be739c440fe37ac1aafd34450","1a23e4aadd76d81d8ab1aaaa656aac80b99d8bed","af0ebdcb9c17ddf40a413d2ff5109960902d80a9","2f8cfa219250b69adbe4cc65eba8dd8ce72c6f59","35ec3be94d3b32a1f7fb066a2cc15d11b870f620","38171bcedecf3f00c11a2586ffd3ad0c64b80ff8","ae826d3bd538c90823bfc25c5298f8e244aaa73c","2cf844c1873c97344ab9d2d8c2b6b3d1d91f688f","93911454a4d27000f8c3b17602412f67b4c5ad02","d6f9bba2d7d3d81d3595555bb143f2427e2b4e12","d9059311da84ea1d2d2a33b927f1d86f93ba5067","15c7fc917593630b6e99d949dba59135448e5e7f","46a5ee76c189beb918464bd22f96994c85dd7830","3d9b8d0770efc06049d825f07b6453676c0e5ad7","095a4977599063c070d763a973d1f33e068ff93c","a66268c51ada37ad16c0f2e6e49438ca3bc40cf0","db29b91924528802bca8e0f30961f10572af4f34","2758ced9bfdf0f31411e0a1df0e91a24a50372f5","3aa6c04a22216e0f78e4e57a76c07227757fa5ba","098d3e1fedbfe870d886c3c56daef13dce2965ce","3d0ec593bab6f64ef44759babb660be66b13ffba","49010838f3e05b25a8a0e2b72f2f4057f42ad5a9"],"pdfUrls":["http://cse.unl.edu/~grother/papers/tr016011.ps.gz","http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&context=csetechreports","http://cse.unl.edu/~grother/papers/icse02a.pdf","http://www.cse.unl.edu/~elbaum/papers/conferences/icse02.pdf","http://cse.unl.edu/~grother/papers/icse02a.ps.gz","http://cs.oregonstate.edu/~grother/papers/icse02a.ps.gz","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581358","http://cse.unl.edu/~grother/papers/tr016011.pdf","http://www.lcc.uma.es/~av/wodpec2004/papers/4-belaunde.pdf","http://esquared.unl.edu/articles/downloadArticle.php?id=80","http://www.cs.orst.edu/~grother/papers/tr016011.ps.gz"],"title":"The impact of test suite granularity on the cost-effectiveness of regression testing","doi":"10.1145/581339.581358","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581358","venue":"ICSE"}

XChek is a generalization of an existing symbolic model-checking algorithm for a multi-valued extension of the temporal logic CTL. Multi-valued modelchecking supports reasoning with values other than just TRUE and FALSE. Multi-valued logics are useful in software engineering because they support explicit modeling of uncertainty, disagreement, and relative desirability or priority. For example, 3-valued logics have been used for interpreting results of static analysis with abstraction [5, 10], and for analyzing partial models [1]. The intermediate value of the logic is used to denote missing information. 4-valued logics have been used to model disagreements that arise when models drawn from different sources are composed [6]. The four values represent the four possible ways of combining the two classical values of the source models. Our model checker generalizes these approaches it works for the class of multi-valued logics whose logical values form a finite distributive lattice, and where there is a suitably defined negation operator that preserves De Morgan laws and involution (-~-~a = a). Such structures are called quasi-boolean algebras [9]. Classical logic, as well as the 3and 4-valued logics described in the literature, are examples of quasi-boolean algebras. In [3], we describe the properties of these logics. For tractability, we restrict ourselves to logics with a finite number of values. Examples of these logics are shown in Figure 1. 1 (a) is classical 2-valued logic, l(b) is a 3-valued logic suitable for representing partial models. 1 (c) is the 4-valued logic","inCitations":["9d3b8a0174c760bc47a20eb2ec600b7870ec8a15","fd071034a22cd9d28aa85b6c492813b15659a75e","85fcb09f90a53bb2a797a5e46b0140b1c048aa30","ec2b3e803aa71e5d5c87255bf17859cdf8fcbe1a"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.computer.org/web/csdl/index/-/csdl/proceedings/icse/2003/1877/00/18770804.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/pubs/icse03-2page.pdf","http://csdl.computer.org/comp/proceedings/icse/2003/1877/00/18770804.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~anya/papers/icse03.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2003/ICSE03-demo-paper.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/pubs/icse03-4page.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776960","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marsha_Chechik/publication/2860180_Chek_A_Model_Checker_for_Multi-Valued_Reasoning/links/09e41510c2bdd32e47000000.pdf"],"title":"\\chiChek: A Model Checker for Multi-Valued Reasoning","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Finding suitable replacements for framework elements that were accessed by a client program and deleted as part of the framework's evolution can be a challenging task. We present a recommendation system, SemDiff, that suggests adaptations to client programs by analyzing how a framework adapts to its own changes. In a study of the evolution of the Eclipse JDT framework and three client programs, our approach recommended relevant adaptive changes with a high level of precision, and detected non-trivial changes typically undiscovered by current refactoring detection techniques.","inCitations":["1bcc640ae718bee9a712259bb524d0833797865b","a7096ce73639cbdfdb23b7f5b6c7c6b8484ca665","b9c595452f3e93203ce0637a7d3b2d7438d2882f","3d9cf21061d2a5382198d11e33013d07dc3d4ece","ee48c8d5a7038b727948b29470cf9d88d3ededde","3abf9027852bb598f89030131f4d0c844b57b357","325e93779d2d021261f0f7faabb305e3bb0dabd1","0a4d4d227997b70933bf4af8016062caa048d985","ddb60cf784b8f13bf0197f1442f2b639b9086fe5","a9a51a154d01b81ab3bda33831f203c0d3d9be4b","08717656614688e30e3a23c853cceea9d61d2af0","457ea06c6fe4bdca7c61f06bd428fa95f24ac38c","ec04b977d6dad1926270dcc35b6346f9059d8e92","d1f86bd84cdd680d567eef0c2f7d3df7ebb90821","cc3e8478ac52ceb4637bff9e5a5de7dee238d4d7","050a967859f0c7622c7e0d4308f84c75878afe14","80b6f7682ee91aab1721b0ef4d8dffbd6c3137d9","2f9737bef03381924b111ecce0dd69ace5747c93","9e93a9bac27dab3e0f1d4d2ab6e1038c524d192e","efe8079160bb66d4df86b1531ec03c17b0ecd3e2","01932c05c22f78aad12615dd5eba841e5f20194d","a3850d363ce6b7029e7332962644096ef5ce6027","188f31b563cfa13b8439c9b62b1066207012b88b","9cc6d4bebb3e985d3a02df1d0f86dbab7bcd127b","20757c5a3012fdc0059e783104a7192557558f40","46cbd8fabcb093272bb7bbe3f10bdd804c5cb7f5","bb01134d00ee942c88e6f1135666f675c3b79d44","1c159db22f8a6e7c177d9c9fdb5c3972514a12f9","d46ef34bd6d319aa872910808a66afa0a41143c9","3fecd4862346822f3e1867a4e978ee5490310513","755c40905a95532f87a51414c759272d59cf0ab5","6014eebe12e9d39eeea4945d45497f8bed61b7c3","414d6964322c0e5b31cc4457ec09c3113e4be0bd","4c0ef5534f6130a988d593fd63f751ffbd068642","a060fc2099b498830f36ca95cac148ba5cf9a911","0dc31b50b18329c531f2bca394ff3c681f40f8c2","07f24609348eed170f3ac41f5a77158e576dea6e","693d7d0c483386c624e49517d597f788c6805fe4","06a699b4d9b576d832f95ff1bc360b61af203de4","9bf22890e928c8e3c43b6f49d65b61e215aaaea4","0ec1af9988fca45cd28908594b12df0f638fc302","8ceb11ffd73d05ffd84ab615f98ca0524031f1a9","43ca58d738e5bde73a2e324b766d66315a9cc30d","d4a8aac8c1ef6cd9dc96b25765c8cd82456f3600","fa2df2820e5ba7aace8351115dc5a5d87f420f91","0529df59b1fe1c460dee3b57ac98258c9b022a95","cbaa15d59bf7d2695812d902b4a1a3d8535e7d77","7ce33612f90ca7f31a5939304a0281ef9d380a67","cf944edcd5a5d5489e5a8c370bce66d1fcd7b333","767245cd5eeed6a94365e5a767099deb1c34263c","13697435e2ed130db7d0d453d346e50257c26069","35bb635c93aa34771ca79d2d6b68d3fa0cd40351","12e894f2914acefd6bde20e314de0cefaa8efbcd","35ca83c3bc262579f304419c06179385f651f271","753084df632264d0d3fb7d0fc71ea5d2bb6851f9","7825d1ff587fad182a99599a8510e28ddec8a3f7","c18a418e87491d496f2f2bdd7167f62530bffabd","21112167d4d808446572aa3e73310686530e3e25","04668906b4f9d45c45fd7bf52ce5a246da81dddc","79e168d6d335a660d909fd6dab1aacb0fdbc8c7b","a54d1dd26c79b2cf90debd764d4ab8cf19d900f3","90ad05aefd4d9cb460bed30463d01078b4496854","050bdeb5ba4f7a6aaf71cf27803a3e79b1eec647","0897ff595f7aaf2c64fdcb3fb4b544080fbf1731","2dc84b46ee0779719b792b9db3b5efbcbd07c595","7a4567c922705938d74f09ddec5e3ef0c51693e6","1f5f1011a0cde20942a5a3b44c7e0d9b55ebdf5d","efe6874bef1890d1f8b0e9296d431fbe6c68a881","18d00fd23f634546f295875d8c0a0a1489c14ec4","32ac25f7422093b28f6614e8ec0cb749c11d1c62","927aaa20318d18564bd331ed37428e05820d647e","0f7c0168c6db2d86de0512050d73ddc804addc3e","1641e8e5f16ffce6abdc5c9ca4bb23ce36671602","a15c50103db4b2bc55c83ad606a77f90d0f42700","3c05ed2ae3f72620861d61ece7a80fa38d43bde3","05882b3376dddab5066015b46704bb7bfe3946cc","01ef89818000fa5aeda17bd4a888f48166aa3f13","e1df955dc9b57b85f9421e1909c59d6b36fb3f49","06b1b3be928de83c53b664cb4de735d0c169a130","8b659f9a54b36382c2d162edcf859cf515039675","934c69da940ea5e32efdf64f0af0bfd46db893d9","f24b52330d5eae54fc5a23798bfe779140f68666","1bcfc022a91e8239073910cf50bb63e5c60250b8","84bdb2ae05a894db5e4c03a797cd8876ea9d079b","2e2712ae656bc06a137ae6f9c3a677834bfa7e2c","42e4e7d3500887c031ec1a883f75c62d39215dcc","18427d980e196c34fd0a82f1cb1bcf4d54b6bfa1","b84283ea90d6afe516e6dd9fae296a8a95292bb5","f2b7b54885ed3860678d873d047e59dbae99b1da","96623f6f1792b7d841d8637afad2716aba088781","588f3228429cb6f37c92316584cfcefedf121814","d1bb0649f5b2933e56cec2a0a961d31f58f1fab8","98f2ccea361961d390c0b23b6cdf087125442163","9202e219bdb1d1cc0032885a321b9b9eed15433e","7d62fa46a14b2bbd601d5b95b8179fad97840bb2","21f07abad970093f561ef60bcbbee3830643fe55","0d80ff83bdd53bfec22c55722cb911ef4c9e472d","303d723a9a34309c130bd05d20395d2392b39860","102056b4fc558caf74a7557150cf543529ed1657","3cc7a665dacc39f41780af01832c69f129f25767","310a8ae3de93b01b300bfa0825110b2752ca150f","22b22af6c27e6d4348ed9d131ec119ba48d8301e","9b287ba9a1b848fafeb9def8271e85eb9cd09ab7","612ec8d4d8a4630c4823b6b6bbab0fd283b13125","14515004dd9c5e0fff89223066efde9f4b5044a0","702ac88b55150095a6cd63890e0069de04e1ef5d","5447a3b8701d59f3a2f1a7f7af030f687ba495c3","0e0a73b2436380de9734ed1e2ae23e7b81f149d4","3136ad216d30bdff223e5c3f02e07f980a6a45a5","27efc0c439e8a425ec9c2f317866d3964e568dbf","4456121062db0edf6d3034391b0f5a0b865fd503","dc6cff0d33ff7249f190ee60237d76f03f213f82","90a6e62952c52e640fd32929925c141941e9f548","095994a9207b13366f23753aa783d67058d16a8c","40b58bc757224123faf4aa6790c8d92844fcb88d","a6236553d8d1bc7c0d45de54e3

We propose a novel evolution methodology that integrates the concepts of features, regression tests, and component-based software engineering (CBSE). Regression test cases are untapped resources, full of information about system features. By exercising each feature with its associated test cases using code profilers and similar tools, code can be located and refactored to create components. These components are then inserted back into the legacy system, ensuring a working system structure. This methodology is divided into three parts. Part one identifies the source code associated with features that need evolution. Part two deals with creating components and part three measures results. By applying this methodology, AFS has successfully restructured its enterprise legacy system and reduced the costs of future maintenance. Additionally, the components that were refactored from the legacy system are currently being used within a web-enabled application.","inCitations":["c1248e719616d2ec92813388ddf1bfb21571e1a3","76814c0268e2b125655225c4a50221b52b3ae410","546b877f2a957ff80a920f50e9eb1feba6239608","e0fb542b872d38bd6ba910631421933881e64523","368ae35db276eab0ee55ba0c9bd8f090d0f05318","cc07353026c290b6aba28ad5913a93d0599f0ae8","17be332aaa2cd20b805ee681048870e44eed7caf","e7b61dd83353123587325e87b691f90752daa1e3","4df68142a84cdabdb9b5728033ab0a87df3bba3b","37e29c33ac6724ea0bba0ba06711e6f371b97191","fefcb13b50499747c9314445b67ef099009dc5a8","73891c5dc954e06b7c00285431b3e1d264715c08","c05e8741d86bf59f0696a46f81bf7ad044af264a","9d2ab1538c434c98675b7a8dac85cce34b5d2f6e","60f518fcef1a1cb163eaac94b23599350a29ab39","274e46d9584c0ce577c83c822e54b342002c210d","74f87bf8e34ee2c382600991f528ba19da954072","981cea2e7447e71ddecc7f7d013b8584a0083ad5","ac8eb4daaec2018e9ed2eb47a1157c7a053f8338","16c0ddb2df56bbbd2532a66fe10d853f7464393c","2c03d259509909000c0799a98ad9745d4488aef7","d1368b2c3e29c559996600a2b3ddb74ba3fd25ca","4f99237fc9fb80f43d82675af01106161b9f1e46","69d70cb69a09948b0f1b2fd1b92e2aef88508275","343989b382769c0e8c5d5bc49f931d334ce35c8e","2abf2324e771f9e65cd611c633a7ca1f87527329","2fbf9eb97ad047e59f839083b7afe5ebe3fdc357","441e7618714433c48e196a210b165a304d7a00e5","2a15f935ab049847f9bff257782eadad9685473e","cdb646df72efeba6c1102ab894302f39f2376ac9","dc86acdc41906fc29f77c31b5bc83810e7a44d85","067fbc82021c6ae5a1db84561651dad54abafee1","76dc531c904b618ca160d7255d5b0842118176cb","b2c930fb5a6d31024c43eb7fe47c962135d9ef5f","f0daf5cd381bdcf5f81ae4a732d030d95a0cc676","1ff4eeedfb735f79d7bc6ba133e242e8f0fb5b2f","df938a4429eafde46d6025aa53dff6d14bd840db","fc67850dd20355a82834f07af59ab8af48f02b7a","7ffef70f9b1acd9d2070f2d6af39ad21a494ac6f","53e21466acefa955175bb5d3e771a64ff486b389","b5e2c60a2e02476e525057174f86c32f58439db9","07803b50ead941b1fd1f860c2f08fc4707020e48","c862bdddeed7a773f6cfedc06acb388d57d7590e","8f3ee387a3853185db408d462682ed17b1e47485","799169e956f803c4f26c923107abcc9453835bff","5add4037c6152fffd1c2b1aa9e9ad13fba66ec88","82f300b93ed2a1ed000c46afdfdbfea15e19be34","e175972d669e61a6d536108e7fe2c801ba089073","2a6506bbe89e43144faa913a82637a48cc4f281b","6135703ca808bf1083616cbfcc27391660cabbc5"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=25746&ptid=712&t=evolving+legacy+system+features+into+fine-grained+components","http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~heineman/PDF/ICSE-2002.pdf","http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/ghazy/CBD_MSc/Ref-23.pdf","http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~heineman/PDF/ICSE-2002.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581391","http://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/25746/"],"title":"Evolving legacy system features into fine-grained components","doi":"10.1145/581339.581391","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581391","venue":"ICSE"}

Such monitoring can prevent fraud, encourage careful maintenance, and serve as an early detector of irregularities in the state and behavior of a system. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the concepts of on-line and independent monitoring. This conflict is due to the fact that on-line monitoring requires the embedding of some kinds of sensors in the base-system. But the introduction of such sensors requires a degree of cooperation with the developers of the base system, and may interfere with the operations of that system, contrary to the requirements of independent monitoring. We describe a way to resolve this conflict by applying the concept of law-governed architecture.","inCitations":["96169a2e4b841ead0e3170a84223180cf09be6cd","2efd738746e563285cde126dd2ceac207e30cc1f","27d4c95187205cf7ee5698d6b38709cab9368c72","ffa877c44e842ec02fdb01fd833ccb6732a9668a","8e741993e945a55aeec5da86c2d7df81bb5e64fc","73faf998cae9c5b2bc98679da5060743a8c4e608","3335f0d1d87bd4a8d911e265e2a70b0df4558c27","da5c8013d83ff2046ec2d7bb1eaa74b57584164d","85af5140b46d042a6027f4f63e856f994d0ae0d5","1bf32be28bfcef061768fcb31b01f62d5049ab6c","25b66f6f0b41530e14ad61b700eba5bd0c6aa782","a62d158cd4ee1894ab66ce753331ac2b1ce00a91","683e386b30bc2b0876946f174e49c060e2db5343","4e0310fe5fbb2ab66ffb4a0594aa0b264f400dac","077b7921d8b44f8969fc676d60aa841052ee885b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~minsky/583/audit2.ps","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=227726.227753"],"title":"Independent On-Line Monitoring of Evolving Systems","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Initially, a distinction is made between software design and program design. Software design is then described in terms of evolving a system architecture independently of implementation considerations. Computation structures are introduced as a means of modeling the dynamic behavior of a software architecture. Functional completeness, quality, machine independence, and performance completeness of a design are then used as criteria for engineering design decisions. Finally, the basic elements of a system to support the software design process are described.","inCitations":["22518e278b242dd5279e6071362b342301c7c2ec","b36e8542667728dcee0354c7ff9d787f9a33e048","1e19b040bca9eac75ac43771218f7f9cfd764db4","5d6d40dd0511135136782b79c3bdb0eef8afbaa8"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807678"],"title":"Towards and Engineering Approach to Software Design","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Over 5500 people have obtained degrees in software engineering since 1979. The authors are conducting the first of an ongoing annual survey of international academic software engineering programs, as a joint ACM/IEEE-CS project. This status report covers: history, audience, initial survey, initial partial results available on the WWW, request for evaluation of WWW-site, request for additional questions for next version of survey, time-line for next version of the survey, “lessons learned,” and some future directions. The annual report and survey results will be posted on a wide variety of web pages. A more current report, based on the sabbatical of the first author, will be presented at the conference. The sabbatical involves the initial development of an “International Software Engineering University Consortium - ISEUC.” A sample scenario for an employee in industry who becomes a student in ISEUC is given.","inCitations":["97d39e1ccf8e5b0286df3f2335267b6545e0c851","85ca4d0cd70f2c4b580c4b4a36b8716b53af5fdc","27ea88cce780f4e155810cb623e12f99534389fb","9c855a4e929bfda6c4f0670c4b1975f685e8986d","4c48d47ee9ce9c9cb098c20631e7767d0d621cfe"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919139"],"title":"Academic Software Engineering: What Is and What Could Be?

They are typically given by using conventional notations that lack well-defined semantics and, therefore reasoning about their behaviors requires formalization. Even when formalized, conventional communication abstractions may lead to too laborious formalizations when addressing the temporal behavior of a pattern. as a whole instead of behaviors local to its components. We show that rigorous reasoning can be eased by formalizing temporal behaviors of patterns in terms of high-level abstractions of communication, and that by using property-preserving refinements, specifications can be naturally composed by using patterns as building

In this paper, we propose an approach called BSR (Baseline-Statistic-Refinement) for establishing and refining software process performance baseline, and present the experience result to validate its effectiveness for quantitative process management.","inCitations":["20cf320311a5797189a6a8a100e7d2431d7b7dd7","882acfc2031d107120ac678099981a5400ec656f","7a7a807f500c42a4f9ee2206692f8140cae8265a","9f904c3e0403dd024c8f85d53524fe55ce0ea767","294d65890abc6d25be2bebb7fa6b61264e2683eb","e03ea1894150f72be891b61546fd54965428c4b2","fe010c744ed1b5c4432ffdc6818003f81882a81a","7397fe4513a84748e650165ae04d53e5a5732f8c","ef35c394d823e6abfd1f44a867fd5547279ddcdb","a9f05ad068f2d3bb7d97b18ee9e0569478df5f89","9ac9ea2a5fe46979424915425e73fc2c156702c0","3fea7fe62e3a87797522a574d1c7275e10ca1902","786623b7bad9cb2cede528f42cc158bad0bfc131","ba31f138ba00e28b0555d162f482216f51467dc8","9481037a7a3082437d8588a1f4d4da81ad67ed8e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134368","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.456.6704&rep=rep1&type=pdf"],"title":"BSR: a statistic-based approach for establishing and refining software process performance baseline","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134368","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134368","venue":"ICSE"}

We found that many problems arose because developers were forced to invest great effort recovering implicit knowledge by exploring code and interrupting teammates and this knowledge was only saved in their memory. Contrary to expectations that email and IM prevent expensive task switches caused by face-to-face interruptions, we found that face-to-face communication enjoys many advantages. Contrary to expectations that documentation makes understanding design rationale easy, we found that current design documents are inadequate. Contrary to expectations that code duplication involves the copy and paste of code snippets, developers reported several types of duplication.

It is surprisingly difficult to write these properties correctly. There are rigorous mathematical formalisms for representing properties, but these are often difficult to use. No matter what notation is used, however, there are often subtle, but important, details that need to be considered. Propel aims to make the job of writing and understanding properties easier by providing templates that explicitly capture these details as options for commonly-occurring property patterns. These templates are represented using both \"disciplined\" natural language and finite-state automata, allowing the specifier to easily move between these two representations.","inCitations":["304be5189b867f9eef8fa5229db79b40a6880f28","cbc9dfa9770c1ad07568949955fc76e30e9d7b71","ae9e67ea16e364392009241c3a6d9ca26fd2bd68","9e7464a874f9451308bc19adfc9d9e92aa54ee7e","0e4af2d2c702c138959843e7bd0f04c9510e293c","8fd91f0ab3549fd51a819c904085fa7275c4952e","603506c19a215b0c7b24503508958198c27aeeee","13c4b8dba3d1583cf03f2c0630bfc9f2c4cfbbda","a88d79b97f089544e4012ef70118929706cf680c","442d42ca391d0baa54c34969fc9a1dc7c374c851","0aad908bc74cfad98bfb3d8ed48fad1d64bd14cd","5c52df48b02ec204ebddee507613adc6b4799e6a","3cb426d4307e0c2ad924ae2fd6e914f2d62191a6","4107744b1c6609ff17a776b967a244737a91c520","36f94411a4970f86e4b1f02cd52ae76abd202ec7","08a66ca4911e64a4c60cdf101611a569bca6fecd","72db51a55498a17b5224e475ad6af1c916ccb2b1","7cf38f85d8ccfbcc91f4f20f9eb9ce3a4b403023","1b0715764e74d76e4a171cd191a5b10d551c4224","1c79cc227b4a4599d4a6182d00e2acd9f3082b83","3f06782edc8e42fd3c36ee4c916d28476a92934f","5a36e247808054a5e7ff630848f95a36e0292815","576191c5a0d70471ed1658bc1ed803ffc6bae350","8acde076075240a69c3316f7aa9bbba487bbe866","636b185eb46f91988b129baa883d2c1b9d5367c8","11e7942c54e7f1c39c62fc97ecb52f1ec725c736","928ed1368a1b95868b789b570f6f4f3e616da168","1f1df3c0920559145e1bfe9160e68b374f1d9629","2d60bd6a1d4745f8686acd4b38be0229d58a5643","3fe3f247035cc30b39f5266f6a81271ced9971e2","7d9643cfb5dea8b0e20e68c8ff503bbc17faccd5","219e65180f71b8e29362d8f0960c9509a8328c4b","8619bebf9afd03324961e783e8380af90e06c883","45ddbb5f835cc929148ed179e92be7fec03b65c0","9a486279ec51cff9af42838a976940e46134bea6","93e08d2364b5904a063dd3d33ede7e6d88fb7281","2c2d7890900dd68318822167b9856a791fa152a4","3ec9aa92316da33b6216806fdfb983e5cff0a434","9ca903d9b46c15e455f4bba1643c3dd9e3d67bc6","cdec8a35c590d666d3f47a19e07d4d83ef4864d5","cee238d5ec189a75a826b33ec06c0b7a5749b326","633033a4710fa6beeed6489501de7d1bc372f0b9","fd54fbed23317f03e52f47bc5d3285806584385a","88fcbce3ff2761a9a30f8a54fdd279aed6a8bc05","8ac7a804ece47b7e17e88a995386c568cf1d6e26","4dbd51c6d867c5a701ca6f07a90bd675a0dd0423","59e39d933d940f26fcb7a11e9786b7bc7edcf033","ea0a637370ff5967e26da2803f28c9288817044d","aabc21407392aa97b64b2a93cf00a10c4eb169a8","514f725103a61f3cbecb5f1f8ddd0f49e79e7117","e93480dde8a6c202487356353d62687cd29de774","58a64bea0b3b161eff78f5c7704580cc91b27b80","1005d20be543e69311f34046352353410a8ae211","1d673f33684d466446e2cb427a5c57a3fd487df9","2ff5c1cf26a0a043e4b7658bd4f0228a4b4dc5f7","30fba75f9bfeeb0fc79db6844ca42f299212b64b","052bb9043fc88abc3e70e5191fbd781251aab06e","17c3aae5a5a19088bd120708476c762539040b4f","d9090eaa22ac97eb246b2cd83c68b30ff3e08de3","5af1a4501b3461a482bec83d58eaeca92b63fbbe","08d23b65f12e358a3d902a961cf31a2ab748bea9","dd9b2eeb10bd7d88dd402e06ef1187fa2a8652cd","25ff443e1cdf8ea0e040dc472125b99de69c7ba6","efe8e84c52526af612a9da89ca3c5bf56b6142bc","41bf3a0a7752f90051495d0bfb4f334e577385c2","47882a2d29386666507e1ac6cf1f3c0454cc6727","823e82d60b6a8faae6855f3b81b5d45f6465bb82","6ef7ee02db34a71f0ac263e22fe7b7667925c803","6c63170a3a16b4fc4be5dff3deb2b03762d79c2d","0a14efbef57cd43a8f0873ca1913186312dbc422","4b773841c8359c821c8879ebd228f32e6bde9904","79cbf135165a3527351d56fc3e069f5a428ccc5b","82887ded7a2d4f45a33cecf35a097e8a0edf3908","d0a0bb46b939c46634995832c149860da3c322f1","133df22268d2eff35110870bb2b1c576788d6543","a4df168f7b0d648b03614135a136d790328d8ac7","041e19f581224f0fa3b029fec2f7401c9c98cea5","ea9b4082bfec0822968b53405fd0a054aae41753","022ca2742c8ce42f6f14471af6c0ff8ac8c379de","56aef9e2b11eb5a7eafa9237e129fdb2ebbf61bc","126b6cd157bd10e718abf24c99ba9e161ae8d1aa","33c9d28a6183e9d3a742112ddd8965347d38a574","3997f08affb2088ddd8af00f323a0eaf18d7449f","6640d700addfe80faaabccc88fe0f86d24d24452","5225bf7441210159a53645cee7ca284b611eaf31","75cf50cc3cafd21742efeae1d463e8ced4450afd","77d8dd13115472352b11ba162fe21576f37a4684","208d6bab7d78a414a473f5405cc683a66658caff","82ceb3f2e72243538a6aa8bff1a60070bdeca4e1","010c53be16a3e14ad04e8ecd4c88ba2928d731ba","41bc0092c790233fc1a56633c48868c74f3bd0e7","283ac6b0d8a4d32c4b59cb1be3331c513d0d6001","8f17759f6c0934f9395fa6f0f1916efc160ecfec","850a6f9c43feb33a2e6682258aa4e7f0c2b5c229","62342e645db4d648779e32c53d85964e8e138795","82ce3a944bb99898c336c794ab848a2db977c32a","ae6b55133e3790bf0379c0cfdf485063eb8fc445","b92d261e13cff6e23ff455f86fd4d4cfedbc6aea","409823c7c2a8fbe6a74044145fe2751a05e8c3c2","add5e1fd2f2b364bfd899ea0afe18bfa4d76135d","533706b7ce15eb8d8ceee8ceac842e2dab20d4b3","ab2231bd04a61ba1cde5774ed97eeadd57b40e7e","c9c5eed362fda61de29b86236a8f54db8c6a7d50","c2411613f9254829cccc4848ff414659afac0f76","635826bf41a68ada2299b5be50dccf5651591386","5f9ec124bf9f1fafd1f8cdf9f7fbf3241caa0373","672abe9d73f187b7d047b485be7d1b9b1bbbb2b9","b8f5746fff00e95fe06b1fddbe014b183914d659","6213699c2b46c3891bf874040af60399b5852217","e4d3df51391bbaf72a5c50dc198c168109959eab","b0bc74c12d1dd861756fae370f72aa34d254f717","019e56e6a4de8ebc8e84f75adac8f58eace3be4c","12589adae17fd9d90018808faf1f8de35a036cab","3cda291e15ba4de9fc6158cc0ab02216c29336ab","508432beea940e4a266298c1effc216ec5099148","9c82814c991526cd1b667

Yet we know little on whether developers are benefitting from the extra power of DVCS. Without such knowledge, researchers, developers, tool builders, and team managers are in the danger of making wrong assumptions. \n In this paper we present the first in-depth, large scale empirical study that looks at the influence of DVCS on the practice of splitting, grouping, and committing changes. We recruited 820 participants for a survey that sheds light into the practice of using DVCS. We also analyzed 409M lines of code changed by 358300 commits, made by 5890 developers, in 132 repositories containing a total of 73M LOC. Using this data, we uncovered some interesting facts. For example, (i) commits made in distributed repositories were 32% smaller than the centralized ones, (ii) developers split commits more often in DVCS, and (iii) DVCS commits are more likely to have references to issue tracking labels.","inCitations":["22a064993263e625d634b2dd05b47629246aa168","2efa95c86576f51b18f2bfe63bf3ec52d4469f35","6a1fb65db2096970284604fdefd18cec0ea1707f","3d0264ba98c386c350e5f8dd7af4e50a84fbbac1","85d841955bde30e56419adf9e0fba482eb44fd7e","5854763ee4a627f0b7c81d1760676eb5cd7d7242","c71dd26a7323bec7a337cb50657958f2ab15fb2b","21c5655a9fceb5d7c81c91a01f3fb6ccae32cf98","60a8227554c1e6ff7914a7425f617326210f5a92","948244c48531a1fc420699d8025eb20e2ab61897","37e8e79462b811965d436620780105f5e41e9c97","3841e7164045aafaffa49c17f4dfee6e94f1b79b","3f7d6b0fe883bafd5df6f820ddd3b4d5b688aafe","c1c8c38b19e27915e7912ae22a3a513c7f150c01","3d0779aa0da8edba668cfdc616949c63c5e65fa3","82b90f2d2edeacc0c29cf31e75778ccf4e4d8f63","d962f937ebab6e4b544b6a72f82659c14286a9e6","2db472c646262a777623fad741c9e132c76da3be","4f73ed8eb02a3681cd002c535d7c81309f094ef5","79fad45e3b2e97091f3e97b984a782bb6e974d99","d1db92d598394908bc6f7e4b036bb940de6445dc","1114c713b4e05c32d49eecfbed82731129ae9c72","3f27f8050d6dd0ecfd29ea5c7094587e19c0c617","d7b4e15295d9ecb0c18815639b718237b92e966c","d42949ac5dc2e1544e5afcaf994aacdfefe98705","4d2126d18e54c94542a67027cb700fc1b0d3004e","31ecd2409a708dceed153f340a065f216791ae09","b62ed7de30c4709d1ab39a812d7c71dcb312a682","a90644c91bdde77460302f624af93a6826067e85","34d8f6ab4f47328cdc324f243e12f9236e5dfb56","dd5b90b6a24347b65197819337f7ca441fdc6035","6cbb8841e6774d6c933fc98310f5d1419f4182af","39b9b0b2adcc958846684d21138cb9e0567d4deb","b2d3d103da06b145598c7d310ce7add79ee323c5","f78a35cfb2167a389b65d6ae04ce40d516311692","325712b93c93a943d6e6b13d5c18f9f36b9b0f89","d723faa0e0a7e0bc1f41ffff2f29dc131579f5a1","ac531be267ad831d8b22754522353bdf84e1ea26","14b4ea8639c81681b339c00f1a20073b18677797","12b50a334cf9f633bcd4f6db18db9b0002510ccb","c6f456b9efc7db477f200fd1806742e8b9ec9bf0","cfc8f39a24f452cb0fe005a860c30e5ed5b4b6f6","0884539199137a69e0a858a52d8e0138923c85a3"],"pdfUrls":["https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/vd66w140s","http://dig.cs.illinois.edu/papers/ICSE14_Caius.pdf","http://cope.eecs.oregonstate.edu/papers/BrindescuICSE2014.pdf","http://caius.brindescu.com/papers/BrindescuICSE2014.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568322"],"title":"How do centralized and distributed version control systems impact software changes?","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568322","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568322","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper addresses a different angle of software engineering, that of development for re-use and portability. We consider how an essential part of most software products - the user interface - can be successfully engineered so that it can be portable across multiple platforms and on multiple devices. Our research has identified the structure of the problem domain, and we have filled in some of the answers. We investigate promising solutions from the model-driven frameworks of the 1990s, to modern XML-based specification notations (Views, XUL, XIML, XAML), multi-platform toolkits (Qt and Gtk), and our new work, Mirrors which pioneers reflective libraries. The methodology on which Views and Mirrors is based enables existing GUI libraries to be transported to new operating systems. The paper also identifies cross-cutting challenges related to education, standardization and the impact of mobile and tangible devices on the future design of UIs. This paper seeks to position user interface construction as an important challenge in software engineering, worthy of ongoing research.","inCitations":["09df13b85e2a4941a9ef5bfc042dc5af4caa1151","458989fcd12cb090a05034ae1c6aa4ba23a5aa47","f588875cc5fddbf36a5bd8d27864208be8a76821","1359495f3a73bf609990263e7c8b94ab0d074020","a0fc4a694562d4a2aa5a2557050eceffb92af1e0","0484b0fa3351107e0e9055714f68141aa00b0ebf","319f1629fab31ab27cbba3ea4947e6b5b2689cca","ea76e05b310e5a8512f187b18b7d95de7ea618ae","dab25d0c1f8655644f2334abb0ed8fa500067839","9a42f5049f174255fe4c12a9df62381852c46b34","0e35efed32f6fbabd6d4e1b4c6be3eb1cf599f1a","d18a411103a92b4572eb3b01ab43092612acfa7a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.up.ac.za/~jbishop/Homepage/Pubs/Pubs2006/Bishop-ICSE-2006.pdf","https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf2f/58c6720cdcd4d4819311e56b669ee439a169.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p751.pdf","http://www.cs.up.ac.za/cs/jbishop/Homepage/Pubs/Pubs2006/Bishop-ICSE-2006.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134404"],"title":"Multi-platform user interface construction: a challenge for software engineering-in-the-small","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134404","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134404","venue":"ICSE"}

Such undesirable deviation makes the system hard to understand, modify and maintain. This paper presents a hybrid computer-assisted approach for confirming that the implementation of a system maintains its expected design models and rules. Our approach closely integrates logic-based static analysis and dynamic visualization, providing multiple code views and perspectives. We show that the hybrid technique helps determine design-implementation congruence at various levels of abstraction: concrete rules like coding guidelines, architectural models like design patterns or connectors, and subjective design principles like low coupling and high cohesion.

This measure is used to show that any predicate in such programs may be sufficiently tested using at most m+n+1 paths, where m is the number of input values and n is the number of program variables.","inCitations":["02c9c410f81aff0c0735736e5ea6ca82e85fd35e","0669a175de1e2b3897834e8f4b0c97ebe3681695","691755f0b04b46080771fd413f8438e6b9039580","00cf82a34321cae11ba0011c5e0480aaa875db22","30a3f835d6ceefc7070c10009beebdc48c3273a1"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802531"],"title":"Sufficient Tset Sets for Path Analysis Testing Strategies","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Ample precedents for approaches to these more crucial steps can be found in good engineering practice and applied science.

Its implementation was accomplished through the integration of existing software systems and by the use of modern language system development tools. The result is an order of magnitude reduction in effort of implementation coupled with a sizable increase in system capabilities. The use of a general purpose, commercially available data management system as a data handler and data correlator was a dominant factor in both reduction in effort of implementation and generation of additional power and flexibility in the analysis capabilities offered by FAST.

This measure has to be applied to a set of paths post hoc, and so the problem is to heuristically characterize those paths which will provide maximal test information about the selected predicate; the problem of selecting the optimal set of paths is NP-hard. Experiments have been conducted which utilize the vector space criterion to indicate those characteristics of paths which can best be used to test a given predicate. These characteristics will then provide a selection mechanism for an appropriate set of paths. Other questions involve the selection of those paths which sufficiently test all the program predicates, and to experimentally identify those program properties which lead to an irreducible error space for a predicate.","inCitations":["71cd7192e5ef7f426cd692848d3e4a95433835b1","f4bb77cdd4324de9557801ff8a6d6956fc8b03e6"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319643"],"title":"Experiments Determining Best Paths for Testing Computer Program Predicates","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Ltd. (STEE). STEE industrial projects as well as NUS lab studies revealed limitations of conventional architecture-centric, component-based reuse in the area of generic design to unify similarity patterns (e.g., similar classes, components or architectural patterns) commonly found in software. Further research showed that meta-level extensions to conventional techniques could strengthen their generic design capabilities, considerably improving effectiveness of reuse solutions, and increasing productivity gains due to reuse. These experiences led to development of \"mixed strategy\" approach based on synergistic application of meta-level generative programming technique of XVCL, together with conventional programming techniques. In the paper, we describe university-industry collaboration that proved beneficial for both parties: STEE advanced reuse practice via application of XVCL in several software product line projects. Early inputs from STEE helped NUS team validate and refine XVCL reuse methods, and expand into new research directions. We describe a sequence of projects that led to successful application of XVCL in industrial projects. We describe experiences from those projects and their significance for both industrial practice and understanding principles of flexible software, i.e., software that can be easily changed and adapted to various reuse contexts.","inCitations":["bf468aea7096f53f618f8f0faf99c70e24604b4c","bc0280342ebb09b0e9c0b25f1ef4e4a62db9eef4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p608.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134373"],"title":"Research journey towards industrial application of reuse technique","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134373","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134373","venue":"ICSE"}

This makes such features hard to design, implement, and maintain. Implementing such features within a single platform, using a single language, is hard enough. With distributed, heterogeneous (DH) systems, these features induce complex implementations which cross-cut different languages, OSs, and hardware platforms, while still needing to share data and events. Worse still, the precise requirements for such features are often locality-dependent and discovered late (e.g., security policies). The DADO1 approach helps program cross-cutting features by improving DH middleware. A DADO service comprises pairs of adaplets which are explicitly modeled in IDL. Adaplets may be implemented in any language compatible with the target application, and attached to stubs and skeletons of application objects in a variety of ways. DADO supports flexible and type-checked interactions (using generated stubs and skeletons) between adaplets and between objects and adaplets. Adaplets can be attached at run-time to an application object. We describe the approach and illustrate its use for several cross-cutting features, including performance monitoring, caching, and security. We also discuss software engineering process, as well as run-time performance implications.","inCitations":["b7a6a87f5ca41f300d9169bd01df378cf5a246e9","51d2f3a2168ad2f38ce7446fd3e0c85dc4ccfaf9","57dc4db3beb89007e9be63b1724c6291d9a96aa0","9c729dea069a110a39c96881dbb9e9be705dfcc4","79aa3369eb2c39d1235f93f4472c51ffb4d0d1ec","071bc0b943cabc9875dda472fb72a9f188e1cc64","74358931d5238211d88a8e212b1dad4acc9a6b6a","59543423dffb2ec53b72caa500db7d83b2c248a8","b82ad062df642a2e3b0d93ea43932a964e40863e","8a6e17a288ab63cb824add7a706d45792f35bf57","8caf0594e17a617d8b42d1d04e9c1a46a0f3bf53","df72d5eedc5efc9f13e09a182b5197c824ac0fd4","8c372a7ffb232ddc4b22e773041afe195daf3ff9","addf8750dd1f28374051208938afc8cccf5b5d82","f4dd748742324b7a52751d6bd55a370c794fa806","3029d64ebae3115243c2cdd8a625ab662ddd1423","2caa6757d2a6a51d412fd2a231b6886f04a1a3a8","8db8a2915d54bc6de8e437b8bbbd737d4d710bbe","2a93c15c2f16b3f4bcae2b26582a9309d687df84","c92230444e4d9feea079000147dfde3a47e79233","1c0d09ed1efc3d48636ff580e5e9c5751239cc57","1c997100c1be61c260219d67d54e073e878384b3","fd373714afeb9baa5444a358ca1d3bcaca3d6b64","29ec9bee735444e2af58d7cc2b977d1d72d1d6a2","4e074fc95b5bab072699619f09741bdd5bb52258","19ce474c9a1ceaf6ca5c1ac2180b01ba24370bc6","ab5b2f75a9d88a055420da8f736e50e517006f50","8573a0f08f562b485870e3525483a53efabe121d","cc106b341e58b4386b88ee2662d080f624762ec9","387668e535587bd810c06754175149c4ee2751ca","32a6dce928efd0edb46f8898c02d126cb046c0dd","3a0bb7ee1731b794e36c810780996a1c31935950","0da056e9c40eadd3a53fbd2c5a1bf18ec23c2748","6528375e212f8bfc5bc076055b2c410e1ca38c7b","66809f20229d25070c7fae1835dc0a06ffbb46cd"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Wohlstadter/publication/237436941_DADO_Enhancing_middleware_to_support_cross-cutting_features_in_distributed_heterogeneous_systems_DRAFT-PLEASE_KEEP_CHECKING_BACK_FOR_NEW_VERSION/links/0deec516b929f81074000000.pdf","http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/icse2003-dado.pdf","http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/dado.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wohlstad/dado.pdf","http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/icse2003-dado.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776838","http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/dado.pdf"],"title":"DADO: Enhancing Middleware to Support Crosscutting Features in Distributed, Heterogeneous Systems","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Since architecture-level components often contain complex functionality, it is reasonable to expect that their interactions will also be complex. Modeling and implementing software connectors thus becomes a key aspect of architecture-based development. Software interconnection and middleware technologies such as RMI, CORBA, ILU, and ActiveX provide a valuable service in building applications from components. The relation of such services to software connectors in the context of software architectures, however, is not well understood. To understand the tradeoffs among these technologies with respect to architectures, we have evaluated several off-the-shelf middleware technologies and identified key techniques for utilizing them in implementing software connectors. Our platform for investigation was C2, a componentand message-based architectural style. By encapsulating middleware functionality within software connectors, we have coupled C2’s existing benefits such as component interchangeability, substrate independence and structural guidance with new capabilities of multi-lingual, multi-process and distributed application development in a manner that is transparent to architects.","inCitations":["a692bd2be26d4e6144346d1118ff6515d81cd8e0","a116b03161c3042820b65529248eac51fb69b7c1","2504816f124690eb96d0d8659248a91e32401af9","990386bb5fe865f277e0b531a10f4a8ddcbc7440","4660f76c5783a5c4ddce85e7fccbb7652df7d280","7f5383511f874f95f074be3b66aa245ef12c611f","3eb241d1967c3e288513c660383335f1b7e1388b","e20a42d47b42b27fb4ded97a8df81cdaa6e95295","401f5206f548755592a8e0034c59deca638f159d","2a93c15c2f16b3f4bcae2b26582a9309d687df84","028944e596bbe7fa553bb87286514e0efa1e78fd","06b02aa7b59fe821ad93ddf61436f35f72620691","b9fa20c783b4eaf0485321bcc748c647ed3681f4","b6fc540c3ab477c120ba38e77d79841ee327939c","3b79dd88c41e37612301458872c02806e27ed9e6","37e93237cd7ecb19f94e0dcfd1c419fbd1e48c7c","04109164cad9a03575aea5e0394d177101a4e4f6","4a35ec5a942c41b677bd5a440c658128b6dae12e","1eb559ef1226347a14466eed079253f32d74ce82","eefa263640b1a79d1a55e8bd90356bfbc8bcb455","8a6e17a288ab63cb824add7a706d45792f35bf57","41d13bfab24b277a1061c6a6ef09c931f4c81c35","769b54b3d218845a6a6ef142420a4b0b04c8e299","0a570182b4c558cf890bde57b1b5c1aa2a4d64ed","e53c5720d6ce5ced8983a801f075b45b2bc14c09","1e8435967728a3cf10af9fe6e734d5fa1542f674","15422f8201399162a24e75875de86a9e368706a1","e6cd4ddda8d06bd876d039eb8574a7fd6318e05a","d213de11cb8a14ba5d4f907a14c460cddaf55aa1","12b8344386935ed74a02834891a9d5e7fc6eda7c","2a1c4acf77f90ac09e9444f8caf08352682ab8e4","26d0d1a68b5d7f905c919caba13abb2a31b1f665","82af039d0849241e6a12576427ba318a3dc747c0","e2e8cd9afb0cf72fc47b5ef5c6f29b4a0382bd93","415a1b18b7482f4ec5e59c75f821352b2c8c1ee5","cd6221e1ddc4aa77d09a1da7b90381cb5d1b0ca9","6c0d1047636992761a3d6d6d81bd21b2e362fda5","31e4706ec1ab06cef3f0ea85828f923de1d3fe9e","ce7a1beec7903d41435de517dc214019a033e5a3","38ae210bd30372347a081c2b12d5b1f4b29378bb","f661220cc91b36788233a3000288a47f06d0797b","115ed4242d042356b77984ce305d416689d3c3be","724ee79f69a2b4eef2c2a1344e67c81e408e94b1","29c049ca99d691b59383a819616b69f6a5d775d5","796178648997c22f4b44f0a61ddd349e14304d95","61fcfa5666336d8b9fdbf63ad68daf7389c379ae","19577a9bb23beab0f25a8996e26e808058582d9a","9b83cb83a07e1e91b1d1274c76c793d9bb16e2a2","00aecd6a89fe6df2253dba14e9d2db52a4c14710","706dbf567bfc09be1e7421b1a47ebac40b48455a","d23165b35c2f696d8245e2b432aa912a72c78331","7b76023930285d06cd952a0bb0f3d0a57186f344","e07523401b606064084fd1e88977bdd4a769b156","9e29502687fcc70aa9f54195f4b2fb82142b18ba","5ddf08e4dfd7cdb6b0dc59809969d848ae45e4b9","c2d9acec5e50da4c1f5e78733c7c4013546a7798","41cf56251d61cb0864d8553720c731a42d3f9e79","973a6d21796786779b3c1603696ebdd487a0e0de","8fbaf9654b4cf26fa39feb084a45d2cb6b19a7bc","5c62c4981f9f9a8b8c8d628d76952eb5fca0d054","9f35b91f91a39e4733549edd8256ce1def325aba","d8a1945300749fe0225417dfde2466f676e04734","842adfc2b34cef8fbf04493adadcb394db3513ad","c7280a672398d22b313039b6012b05c50cf70f04"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ics.uci.edu/~edashofy/papers/icse1999.pdf","http://sunset.usc.edu/~neno/teaching/s99/ICSE99-CONN.ps.gz","https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302407","http://sunset.usc.edu/~neno/teaching/s99/ICSE99-CONN.pdf","https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f07f/ccc90bebe0c3ac0922636d2ce73ac448595b.pdf","http://www.antconcepts.com/~edashofy/files/dmt-icse-1999.pdf"],"title":"Using Off-the-Shelf Middleware to Implement Connectors in Distributed Software Architectures","doi":"10.1145/302405.302407","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302407","venue":"ICSE"}

A key concept is the step analyzer, which enables Amalia to automatically tailor high-level analyses, such as behavior simulation and model checking, to different specification languages and representations. A step analyzer uses a new abstraction, called an inference graph, for the analysis. It creates and evaluates an inference graph on-the-fly during a top-down traversal of a specification to deduce the specification's local behaviors (called steps). The nodes of an inference graph directly reify the rules in an operational semantics, enabling Amalia to automatically generate a step analyzer from an operational description of a notation's semantics. Inference graphs are a clean abstraction that can be formally defined. The paper provides a detailed, but informal, introduction to inference graphs. It uses example specifications written in LOTOS for purposes of illustration.","inCitations":["34dc72471f690b53d735ecae23fbc7aabee9b107","c4e92cdd1eb50b1e9cd3283c28b2fcdcdd6fd64c","a3eb74133f5247a4f0534116708941a3caba8a8b","6423693aad7b41504af042d6287f3be64413b804","8cf7ff8ef9591b0f9e6ea86034d56fb494757129","f42a73ef79a56a68d3dbec3eeb83cd0c50bf7651","640551f7b681ea72cf249b17e0cd12805f48ab30","ba1f73aa83d111ffb1768dd2867e340b87ec4fc7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ldillon/Sel_pubs/lightweightAnalysis.pdf","http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ldillon/Sel_pubs/icse01b.ps.gz","http://www.cse.msu.edu/~stire/Papers/icse01b.ps.gz","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919081"],"title":"Leightweight Analysis of Operational Specifications Using Inference Graphs","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919081","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919081","venue":"ICSE"}

Using software engineering principles, we have developed a new communications protocol and architectural style for asymmetrical parallel computations called ADaPT.Utilizing the support of architecturally-aware middleware, we show that ADaPT provides a more efficient solution in terms of message passing and load balancing than asymmetrical parallel computations using collective calls in the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) or more advanced frameworks implementing explicit load-balancing policies. Additionally, developers using ADaPT gain significant windfall from good practices in software engineering, including implementation-level support of architectural artifacts and separation of computational loci from communication protocols.","inCitations":["3d2ae12f7f90dfdf65783515cdd2d3487eee2b46"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134433"],"title":"An architectural style for high-performance asymmetrical parallel computations","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134433","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134433","venue":"ICSE"}

The extension consists of enriching the internal structure of justification in the Potts and Bruns model by making explicit the goals presupposed by arguments, the relations among arguments, and the jirst-class nature of these relations. First, we describe the Potts and Bruns model briefly. Then we present a language whose underlying model extends the Potts and Bruns model, and describe a system that supports the use of this language. Also, briefly discussed are other related studies on recording design rationale. Finally, the limitations of the language being presented here are discussed as further research problems. There are many benefits that can come from explicitly recording the reasons for design decisions. The record of design rationale provides a basis for learning, justification, and reuse of the knowledge gathered for future decisions [10, 12, 14]. To the extent that the representation is well structured, such a record helps us better understand the issues involved in design through better presentations of the relation among the issues and arguments. A well-structured representation also allows the computer to provide services that support design activities, for example, by keeping track of dependencies and by providing multiple viewpoints [4, 7]. In the domain of software engineering, the model of Potts and Bruns’ [12] is an attempt to delineate the generic elements of software design rationale, such as artifacts, issues, positions, justifications, and the relations among them. This model provides a simple representation that can be tailored to different designspecific methods and used for representing the process of design deliberation as well as the artifacts that result from such deliberations. Potts and Bruns also describe a 114 CH2982-7/91/OOOO/Ol 14$01 .00@ 1991 IEEE rule-based, semi-structured, hypertext system that helps the user to examine and record design rationales easily. This way, a design history is kept as a network structure linking the nodes representing the different elements of their model. Such a history provides a basis for realizing many of the benefits mentioned above, such as better understanding of the issues and arguments underlying a design, and learning from past decisions. However, as Potts and Bruns suggest, their work is “the first step in the development of more deliberation-based design methods, new representation schemes, and more effective tool support for design problem solving.” In this paper, we take their suggestion seriously and propose an extension of their model to accommodate additional aspects of design rationale. We proceed as follows. First, the Potts and Bruns model (the PB model) is presented briefly. In Section 2, a number of lessons are discussed that have been gathered from the experiences of using a few representations including Potts and Bruns’ for capturing design rationale. In Section 3, we present a representation language and a system that reflect these lessons. They can be viewed as extensions of the PB model because they preserve its basic structure but elaborate certain parts of it by reflecting on the lessons discussed. We first give a description of the language, called DRL, describe the system called SIBYL that supports its use, and discuss how DRL and SIBYL incorporate the lessons discussed. In Section 4, other related work is briefly discussed. We finally conclude the paper by pointing out the limitations of DRL as open problems. 1. The Potts and Bruns Model for Representing Design Deliberations Potts and Bruns [12] propose a generic model for representing design deliberations and their relation with design artifacts. The purpose of the model is to Recommended by: Karl Reed represent the prccess of delilxxations that lead to a given design, and the intermediate designs that result in the process. The deliberation process is represented with “the deliberation nodes” (ISSUE, ALTERNATIVE, JUSTIFICATION), and the intermediate designs are represented as ARTIFACT nodes. Fig. 1 shows an example. One starts with an initial design, which is represented as an ARTIFACT. An ARTIFACT gives rise to ISSUE’s about the evolving design, which generates different ALTERNATIVE’s, each of which is associated with a JUSTIFICATION giving reasons for or against choosing that alternative. Some of these justifications lead to a design, intermediate or final, which again is represented as an ARTIFACT. If it is an intermediate design, then this ARTIFACT raises a number of ISSUE’s, which may generate ALTERNATIVEs, each of which has a JUSTIFICATION, and so on. As we can see in Fig. 1, a design history is then represented as a network consisting of ARTIFACT nodes and the deliberation nodes (i.e., ISSUE, ALTERNATIVE, and JUSTIFICATION nodes). This model can be tailored to different design methods. Potts and Brtms illustrate the tailorability of their model by specializing it to the design method proposed by Liskov and Guttag [9]. The generic model provides uniformity across different specializations, thus reducing learning time as well as allowing operations to be defined at the general level. Through tailoring and specialization, the model can accommodate the specific needs of the different contexts. Potts and Bruns also describe a semi-structured, rule-based, hypertext system that implements their model. Each node is semistructured in the sense that a node has an internal structure defined by its type specific fields; the system provides its services purely on the basis of this structural information without understanding the contents of the fields. One of the benefits, among others that Potts and Brtms discuss, is that this semistructured representation reduces the efforts required flom the user drastically. At the same time, it allows the system to provide interesting services based on the structural information. The user navigates, browses, and updates the nodes through the hypertext features provided by Planetext [2]. The hypertext is /augmented by a rule-based system, implemented as a Prolog database, that can check the consistency of the knowledge base as well as provide abstractions through virtual links that are rule-based compositions of the existing links. The design history recorded this way provides many benefits. One gains better perspectives of the issues that are raised through examination of the surrounding context in the hypertext browser or through abstraction mechanisms provided by the rule system defined on the hypertext. One gets a kiter understanding of the design","inCitations":["7a2c59be308fbae352cb932a9bf35a74a0a3383a","a35abccbe6316aa5c6d636fc53e582022bd0852b","e7f5e5b1b1b6767e3bebf48aad2a3dec210968f8","78d747d15d91c0e5aa92a3cf0a7e7181e31bd2b6","966471e4a456215d16343dc4728be7c4939fc746","1cb226f42b77db0e274a36d74e73e05214b0f4a3","8ce6c4f7eeadb0a0cb48666f2e57aa452440782c","1dd6de8d054ba6caa9ffce4ca36db41e193d2462","ca4d51a12c5657a0841ba3067f3acf37555ccf0f","1e9134eb11ac8fff97338f2b3c7c87e385be671f","8ec234ba2b07459761f8c8bfbc8a5fd7c4376c6c","96919705993aeae65fa67d76ab3f43ba3020ddce","4dbda34ae2569e53b86d0f141d8db00288981d56","e11804a86f9b27ab1445836dcfc91660b31ce459","750d78070b209b0ae41f3efa62088dec8c935a92","9cefee67a8c5aba80e5edc7dc6032bb71402dc96","042c30140d3d4dabd535366a12abf47168b1cb79","9bc9af934bdf46f289b0df01920ed9afb413a832","8f2b10a5543c5d18944c887e5a4e65313a3e5abe","950b71ce85d49758a584a600a1e1de5c06189ae8","a4ecb35821753dc574255f74b72b919290faf7b5","7d8b085f5b179cb708d3e1d8b31154adce3f3a26","97ee91b8dd77590497520798c9bd044ac0f930f3","91d30551bb6936d5140d658d06c9f5a0b9082682","3c938317c7b9b631d3e8644565fbf9bdd6996fae","c7d145f27877423c31d127debaaf026e985d80e7","78c0ff407736053a845e31d9ee26be4e978b1b39","d42c29ff31605fd2040c0cb141cdf50f470fcc8a","c2fe13c315424ee3ff2308fe2fc16572b700da11","9aae331870920e51a5bfe5aa5702df7002909829","fa312852f008298c8934fdfa150465b8786834a0","76b6e9c41e86787de3a8e501fb1a461a3a7fb280","690e84844e523e60ea7e1fd76f1f5ef1c33e1bfb","e115855dd654a5291e9fd2da46c347f184d8cbbc","288af7ef070e297caaa85e50c1db496ce9e5a015","cdb646df72efeba6c1102ab894302f39f2376ac9","29931c4df126cef61437d4323c1798e228ed573b","2cd245e03c401b28e46a34be15fbc6155ef3c27c","ba77b25014798e0ba535059268274cec1bf4ef56","e4a509b7e9eaa2055df7c33dd18cb337dce7935e","60ec170b4daa7b7bfa754d056e17534ae86f5157","2b68f876a580a618a5ffbbabeddbe43d86102111","107dc3b77937cfbc322f0f224202f2c1ce5fe978","780a689ebc3dd09dcdcf0d7570e2d897274862b9","28d50600bebe281b055fbbb49a6eb9b3acb2b7cf","1d097acabf11c305039dd1ceeed7a4a830a18808","336689b8df161b4d3c981e27db1d389e3c6b6f87","5a30fd3718835c500d1833492d6cd833c959d155","6f499de6c5e5455528b2d141c2ae97b4007c8859","14fa717bc5c50bece7cfc0064154386910bce4e8","c632ffac392bb4ba269b368492bc072f1740bb6a","13812fa37f4d9ccedee7b5e92bcdfaed51748bab","d98dc435424becefadb078e63d9cbe7be216a0c4","7dbc0ce8dd64a298440f89f8b765a9994a793a9c","0ad9e410be0d0965aba88f6f6d0f9807f39960ce","26d3ffb306c8dd520d3133a90aa35ee756f90a37","adb18336dfb13f68048606a0968e6a1403f34cef","549785e4288d2f0c07cb1ece3e4f5ce67cd43e63","ba663ed37fa317c11dfe36fc4ab55bb8775de099","a56487bc8369a72f76f7363105406c9cbf7d3c86","53968d93cd97a502cd039bcda84b078ddc433019","55b712a97285da591e822629bc7739e9786ba75a","ea2214edcdc2a89afac1894c0f67e4e5ef2f25d6","30ea35545fa20c76ed9d68bd835c3d8c5d328b6c","8f0b6e8f1fbea61dada9b3ae44b0ca7286bc028f","c5a2de40164c2f8692d90de22e1870ed6c10a93a","909c6d4186b549b12fc8f371e0f9ae55253ef462","ebc8d6bd63fca86c89872ca10aaa9ba16b901df2","de15218bde8d8e688ffbd9fe3196d7484be2fb17","c1c7182a56642cd026dd22d6b40173234a413ac7","383746b84400b82972ab84fd6027f1524090fa38","8a68710d71b3955bf90eb04ea12bb8065925724d","88987a3d3c4d99ed4ff833a6e115e60ac85a3642","7d621ab4adf9c77bab72b3ecc5f13e67e6f88764","7f04c80491794838d5f0c4ba6ada16d95c485b99","1c5fb5faa3fac39e984c0874d475ae7f624df762","16faacc5f4fb0d92bb3fdda79f8b87e08c4c1767","40fe900fb62f61f19401491ad4486e50735d93d1","50d8b591eb2cd8e9c7ef38018cad1f991a7f729f","84c55f8e8e4dc206ff9b46ec769e2c0e9fed6db7","9fb28c79e217542b1816f506d66396401ebd03ca","04d2bd16fcc7d652190f23756dfe9dd43f33a7ea","014f9aeec32aad7f503e12b980c82a32d47ae3ab","a272267565f72557fa3ff12c44e9d1d08cf03598","a80f00121cca0fb0724e158b8e2e431c89df2396","275dbae5053ea0b7176eff59e6af49713c09109b","416a6438d9a9f3b82bbc6666a6b7ef72b1986c85","24e5ade2f133ba3bc3a2fb43ad380beb5d5e395b","197da19cc101c330cb12f5b63eb5e3251e257086","23d556fc78d79fdcca68ff4e0200238ddf00a835","dd3a485f38ea11bf797efdabba9397f9d4606144","4bc3bc2d66b1d258f1b5927c50db100c2cb3e1ce","e141f22319743aa678a28b115d7cd277b0e3ff9e","dfa298fa631e9901296c1b12b17f525c1e67653f","dfef5479da0bb10f293ddfdc8e15e1b04197314d","1ef8b94720d6eb019c92bb5135a144b07e0acf67","f4b6fe8d464588e3d62442680ce9c9f87fa66761","4b029f558ff9257b8245541a51b548cb85be0876"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=256664.256705"],"title":"Extending the Potts and Bruns Model for Recording Design Rationale","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

A design history is regarded as a network consisting of artifacts and deliberation nodes. Artifacts represent specifications or design documents. Deliberation nodes represent issues, alternatives or justifications. Existing artifacts give rise to issues about the evolving design, an alternative is one of several positions that respond to the issue (perhaps calling for the creation or modification of an artifact), and a justification is a statement giving the reasons for and against the related alternative. The model is applied to the development of a text formatter. The example necessitates some tailoring of the generic model to the method adopted in the development, Liskov and Guttag's design method. We discuss the experiment and the method-specific extensions. The example development has been represented in hypertext and as a Prolog database, the two representations being shown to complement each other. We conclude with a discussion of the relation between this model and other work, and the implications for tool support and

The new distinction provides better insight into the ways different techniques can interact, and is a necessary basis for considering hybrid fault detection techniques.","inCitations":["a9021ffcaa1d9ec5d0a07bb4c0f3948814c44f26","15d0b7cd2eec13c7e37a72c37396077c5efd63d0","098d60b6a3f61f6c8ae9035d9699d4f1559b35c8","e11b021bfb0c9cc77355d25ad0556213725a67e0","e70249dfa8b5fdff7095cd29d5b5594f21c90d0c","35aa34bd8cfdedc8fab63946cfc4d91aaa3ae01d","e0f90c598afbbe423f5270743c1d71f31b8a7bdb","8b60555463260d05fd967c79efde871cfec9117c","b850b422f852fc3e7240a2982c4bf743e27163a7","3e0a38f02fc1003ac996d030846aa6fdc4f9ab00","42a80d5e47ebffa9072c303c5c88822a70566666","e3b3628edcded1f191c2a0b2b58a9b7f6b93faec","11012c701ce4254ad37033de2c762ed2eab6d2a1","1b9844b27cdda9c0627569f60b786bb582e0310e","2b5327b4d7b91b9165cb0720a58fb7239739dcde","9621465bc0eccecf6c6f4ca9c22d2b83ad83e7fd","61a0331720808c6e220b831a6718f528dca96f1b","e3b76566f0f0153860f97c893d7c238f6c74513c","015e808ab039fbb8c6d2d306180a805d123e4cde","b0dcf373cf2b0ff57609d35454e47670102a8dbf","0171a089ee85d384e9fcc82ef0ecf704fe10a44d","05c76c9792b80d0f4669e94c990c722d1327d63f","a0358c05cb9b269854086886fa5b113af69f34d7","9a00eb7b3b43d707038ba53c81622ae87e9567cc","2ca51d212938d202d1ef424d83ebaae9cd8fa168","171e4de98559bf1f91bb1581ae4feec855190285","04e529e7ccf33eedadab3a5582bcd7eed83b16ec","4228ef36fca9925f2aa93284fa4d47d72932a6c9","e8f7612e87554d803250af27cfb8f9cc80e00d61"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2001/cmsc435/Papers/testingTax.pdf","http://hesperus.oboe.com/serc/TechReports/files/TR62P.PS","ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/serc/tech-reports/By-Project/misc/TR62P.PS.Z","https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74593"],"title":"Rethinking the Taxonomy of Fault Detection Techniques","doi":"10.1145/74587.74593","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74593","venue":"ICSE"}

Thus, researchers are struggling with providing suitable programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. In this paper, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to soundly measure program comprehension. In a controlled experiment, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while they were comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors. We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing---all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Our results encourage us and, hopefully, other researchers to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding? How should we train programmers?","inCitations":["a579d2b42a7d8a48a74852901d9b8b4dba2f0b75","4e80b4382dc6a1e554112023c68cbfffa7bb26ed","55ec9f24642c13ca139fa967c327358943cae49d","698ede81acfff9808958b1ce9b9134c6b6a90e4a","655e8db46a38e786911b6a59938de2fee74b240a","50c45ebf87083d161ae351d1d3b839b759687378","0ef7b477bc256e9f897fb3b85b4ff120a8343f9a","01ea922bf934863026d90ef2a2c30fd0654d742a","b8df2f32c46567842146a8c7c9b3d5230a8e8182","e7231f1b144537a069b570e82c09bcc8e1dbb7f2","7a49bf4bf9c9a63d362e783da5c5394d2f55b6aa","9e40c10cb1ad4df32a5b1e01ddedb27f9e4158ad","169e2b20a85979aebd608c7397d4a3969102d4e6","47372dcb51e9790252b8a7e8de4ace24a2430ca3","cbed68c3cf6bf9e63ff15a0b37d87c6a76b18a52","56167a5e39ea74fecd8818e4ad14c0c4f3761b07","b583b33875011a1a63dd0e60e1a74f6172e2f3c7","5b31643267ac8f534b870b440385aef53d9ad1f6","17fbab343a4a0656cf501341c4d829ea18f2fa42","5d1e2cadec743c1b71764790f0220a172b2910a4","25357e92d347542f0a8fb0b63eab53643e59bf65","ab9008679f456846bead46a4ba9588fb6d17b373","97bdec6209e49f48552bddc654327dd3a5d4a02d","66e89d868ad5bfff7cd340186ec86f64d4fc8650","5f13af4463be64e6533002ceb6e868091e3fcaef","48115dc2b4c42c2f553b86f691ab7b0351c5fb6a","94ad5990e9369b666f9c08ce572338bd9e55b6c7","2abd0c8c5117004d0b7b70282b251c4ba4386239","2ebf2e96fbf3d400d3f58878fb615f8ba6a09d3d","142b22825fb7592c6806a48e6b9f5fd45d85ec9d","b790ca3daca116e8ba7c056c1008f92f6913dbc9","e618bf3422e04479626510d8e8853799d7da5fdf","19390972b9126d716f53d756148287d43be9d3ea","36c351cffaa51bc1e4918c1df8147da9dedb00da","dd69e2d7bda393b74452f246ca9f86632285bae2","14e38f3f75f5a8940252178814d10f8e5add74a7","5acc3ac163c078a5fdb6fe12949865f6256dc5fc","2ce0779c1140f37414b28f21dcf69bcd43244804","00af1591d3530314419b4b3c8c5066b5d4724ae9","85e16b21cecd8c43252e7e863e1fabcae16dc546","833230f1396f9a7093455a517e4a56472d596fab","17a10f642f79f2579e6848ee2d88c9e798047f4f","c1e4dda3fe0ac97ce3e967079d823c15a5ee3c22","b80e51253a202f9112c40674a16d822a3110d060","bea6a579ac61363e4baed4ae54c0574bd21e4975","4378fe3d5c62093d909c0c21838c1948c562b8db","718ad10e76aaf104707ea2163af7d9a719b84b7a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/cl/publications/docs/SKA+14.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_fmri.pdf","http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2022&context=isr","http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/neuro/Understanding%20understanding%20source%20code%20with%20fMRI%20-%202014.pdf","https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_fmri.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568252"],"title":"Understanding understanding source code with functional magnetic resonance imaging","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568252","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568252","venue":"ICSE"}

Examples range from the execution cost of operations and details of deployment, up to missing subsystems and layers. The term \"completions\" is used here to include all such additions, including annotations, component insertions, environment infrastructure, deployment, communication patterns, design refinements and scenario or design transformations which correspond to a given deployment style. Completions are related to the purpose of evaluation, so they are tailored to describing the performance at a suitable level of detail. Completions for evaluating other attributes such as reliability or security are also possible. The paper describes how completions are added to a specification regardless of the language used (provided that it describes the system behaviour as well as its structure), and experience with completions in Use Case Maps.","inCitations":["e91b79d151bfff372911ccc6d668b91e11f49826","70a47b3fc9473a4020c51a49357f1c1b4256d08a","c25d3ff4bed93b30ffe24242d8d070fcb6d5154f","87be032d82388fe56651be6deaacc0a5b843bbc1","c2213a6b7c23c81f94b8f193c5e8bc72b1daeb20","776d2d0865265eed93f35ce1cdb9d1a13577688f","caf83ce328e12d3e9723a426122af7f1d8ede214","8bf481fb5ed60a3694553cadaa99e9d3133eb2ac","046dfbcc70617409697e7f4b808ae9c39620c9a0","afd17de4155be2bf88cfa6035f34c1f116b1586b","7ebe220507bdd67443c32375144a7862544dcf7c","902704dd802ed94494750249db8aa1bd98f054ac","fa64c67611c803deb74bd277665fcb14e7b5788e","c78b7147c842cb64a628a5c25dbea6030ccca60c","794a43ce8042372be38a4e7da6480eef15602bba","7aef295bcf6b7b8471b27b91b4c46276e5cf2dbb","e018d6c25774a6d26a2b592cbc5fd1c89801fa73","813f6b966c64274b438dea74f65c5379203e8e78","02ce3409d929f22bea56dc133a639ade33a5dc92","dec1e2e68b7bf1ba45b808422a8be737b861a385","3544e9c91b42485e0f1e45849173ab0a421045f6","38e84ba7185934efdcf4d68dfdf50bb372bfb8d5","0b39a6c137e3124887e39539a128695eeafd03ad","011bb40babf5fc9b11b06d779f6ede61abe7e8ad","aabee8b953d3d6f5c75c08228fba08414c30d50f","897973492e6c15878d674a4719ad5fae29a0644d","54b3db7a06e8753521576f687a89c186ac8efc20","7316163d592e56c7bb8c1f61e2cfa8c4b955900c","468f2f97dc37e8cb100301cc1ff5ac777445588a","03917679596b9619f65f855d339b4402bf762df4","46fe04d6ef4666d33c364f561ce0e214fcfc06c8","36ee958f152af5749507bac981dd7bb3d910531b","77a5842106241a6cb2fdb5c8affe2f2fdc05dd72","64d76802b6686aa471de92e0004d105a91c342da","7a1cce8d52dc2ed7fa73d9a353cf0e45b8af1158","b44edf89d3f0018545d6fc210a37590cb054cb8f","6982c2c80cc3587d0a375b13f674fd76eb8ea396","126c2d2bd286b63e44596aadaf38fce218b213e6","081867fec4d65f81db65d90e36456cc3705e9469","430b44723ec4e8ac653db8d843962aee4ccc9efe"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sce.carleton.ca/ftp/pub/cmw/icse02-rept.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581346"],"title":"Performance-related completions for software specifications","doi":"10.1145/581339.581346","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581346","venue":"ICSE"}

What used to be a system with a separate Input-Output channel or a multiprocessor system or a network without load balancing is now a distributed system. The common feature seems to be a multiplicity; i. e., more than one, of clearly distinguishable modules, as determined by the beholder, operating simultaneously. This paper is an attempt to categorize distributed systems so that one can examine the generic characteristics and problems associated with each category.\n The first step is to realize that distribution involves the apportioning of a set of tasks among a set of entities that can perform the tasks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807664"],"title":"The Structure and Characteristics of Distributed Systems","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

One of the difficulties in creating such models is uncertainty about the accuracy and completeness of the models. Engineers therefore make assumptions which may prove to be invalid at runtime. In this paper we introduce a rigorous, tiered framework for combining behaviour models, each with different associated assumptions and risks. These models are used to generate operational strategies, through techniques such controller synthesis, which are then executed concurrently at runtime. We show that our framework can be used to adapt the functional behaviour of the system: through graceful degradation when the assumptions of a higher level model are broken, and through progressive enhancement when those assumptions are satisfied or restored.","inCitations":["3da2f9d43707e88aed0ad9ade0798b1645402899","0276030ee24b79d037c56f64aa92b7dd0a16932c","24f4bac812bef13f5552c7dbf3c58bf692f0492e","04cdeb8f940a720582709e533cb2817f64782696","4cb0cbbc6fe0926d720f085c4f3373f37bb2c787","d52e9f8727f14e3727a765b5a6e2aa4164325e4d","27359564ccc384687429412179ad3ebc01b39fba","f540a79596af6eb569e65c9af46e89fc2115be1a","6cbb40d4ddebecb756341a6350d56add94ab213f","0684b04be7dfcf05071ea321dbd2748d9dff264c","63f12ebbed15847fcb4f9e208aa8d8e81d950b8c","fbf4a471d7eafb7c0934a1b693a247735fa6187a","67bef7432b0656837a71e47f43f88d9004bb8f40","30bc0feeefd2745719b23c353d53404c4eea0aed","1c378fea49783997cea0f0488c73f7d24faf91e5","1d52476ee0953b54c6e6f76dc086d629329ebec1","398f4b0fdc37e8f534bb56d5e0c3ef6590d357e9","1a83e14d3b1ac5a17187b7c71e9f461a6a398abd","022c15c0815f9256133d34480dd429d68325984b","6965d6fba35af2aa1dfdc9c02dd8e92ff26b91d3","952345123ce8595f860b404194352a5575a389f9","d58e3896daae93b53b2f0edb91ac6cd98cf6b286","1fe8d5f8206c2c14763f6242ee731b12cad2dcf6","0f3e14dba52153fd5c17073e1ff2aa9be5cda95a","5464f1332ad0660aadd018af199889f374671863","99472daaa7e9e7f4347cac8f986724664d5365f7","9822dd8e0926fd9fd8954ca45dffc88374308bb3","031f97fec9e01292283846e32fe9a2ec739f29ca","c046dcb34817935b387f881309da5505cf18f9a8","08573bcd34af3d7def27e49b61b324e85485bd1f"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2568225.2568264","https://meals-project.eu/sites/default/files/hope%20for%20the%20best_0.pdf","http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~srdipi/files/shl.pdf","http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2014/DBKMSU14/hope%20for%20the%20best.pdf","http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~das05/icse2014appendix.pdf"],"title":"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst: multi-tier control for adaptive systems","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568264","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568264","venue":"ICSE"}

The IPE is a knowledge based tool: it gains its power by explicitly representing textual, syntactic, and many of the semantic (meaning related) and pragmatic (application oriented) structures in programs. To demonstrate this approach, we implement a subset of this knowledge base, and a search mechanism called the Program Reference Language (PRL), which is able to locate portions of programs based on a description provided by a user.\n This research was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under contract F49620-81-C-0067, the Office of Naval Research under contract N00014-82-C-0119, and Rome Air Development Center under contract F30602-80-C-0176.","inCitations":["d0a7a89a84b33a2b15f3685fd005f1afd12ac6a5"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801995"],"title":"A Knowledge Base for Supporting and Intelligent Program Editor","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Unfortunately, these invariants are usually absent from code. Previous work showed how to dynamically detect invariants from program traces by looking for patterns in and relationships among variable values. A prototype implementation, Daikon, accurately recovered invariants from formally-specified programs, and the invariants it detected in other programs assisted programmers in a software evolution task. However, Daikon suffered from reporting too many invariants, many of which were not useful, and also failed to report some desired invariants.\nThis paper presents, and gives experimental evidence of the efficacy of, four approaches for increasing the relevance of invariants reported by a dynamic invariant detector. One of them — exploiting unused polymorphism — adds desired invariants to the output. The other three — suppressing implied invariants, limiting which variables are compared to one another, and ignoring unchanged values — eliminate undesired invariants from the output and also improve

This framework is then used to evaluate and compare ezisting selective retest algorithms. The evaluation reveals strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and highlights problems that future work in this area should address.","inCitations":["6a8810f7faaf39d3d402b07e030513824345e4a0","37f476a9bc8f13a76a9bc44353603a7c5ab38179","fb62d8d74cba4477262ca850b08adeea2ae7cfe4","895b2a3ffb81b95e4b8265ff6e8b15f83db63cde","4393e3d118269f374df7f9828a7be034b645336b","4a72dafac8790127319748235de92e8eaf02568c","d81551a599561eff08b6edd4cf2c3e3cec778bce","c3d0c36f9bd1c42b31f12c0fda6e2b1dd993edc7","f88fd35a76379d8461230e66adad4900597a90e1","c12369e721d3b44c52ba42be30c7b8b14f83d693","d685ff6ea049f37d93fb15dfcf8f9c4fc8748ede","009c7894488eb4dfbefab297712f38b32458d22b","a1cd40e05df72eca01ffae893e0a4a92a87ae23a","59a46ed7e19d301b6b1472b85f242c16a6713b4c","9b57883270b3b35dc29e53c0b5973e43ac8bf6a2","8197b13dd7d3560dc833e9c89fd97e4c7aff2b8f","b6ef4301ca6922d7542c86a98003a498532ac3f1","1f1361d504b2e0e7a1222c501a37b7bce0305ee7","f38ee1191bd2dc5f7cad9572ca531972eb62972e","50ecbb40065ee5d8208bc2932ac9f652a4526836","1dd56c062c65583b0e6d2e8a5d5d9733a2c85bee","40ff132929d8912e286caf250ef680c039b488a7","bbe43875b5fb8f194e7e13f1882928ba3e701af5","bf0258745df5ce25b57d4e2f0dc4b473ec956139","b533771b83d19370ff970700156bb943277de43f","3d835e1128d1f072c4416665d9dde38609f38584","4c76c53235786488d6202a4555176ee74e940008","639f09dc0b407b4aadf34038cd9df14b88f0b401","d6f9bba2d7d3d81d3595555bb143f2427e2b4e12","d24cde6f05d58a9f20d37c25f0ac07ad85ba574f","46a5ee76c189beb918464bd22f96994c85dd7830","62172675b3280348a83977a4c33ba0c5ac3d22de","eec588fcb0f2ff1c84813c07cd66a69011813358","1c03464e57ab2c50e8217e5a1141ee19bb9ff4eb","1e681c99b75ac8d8957e18c998549bb08497c4ff","3aa6c04a22216e0f78e4e57a76c07227757fa5ba","9966bee499c6681b8ea2bf59a38fae40e3b431b8","8cd16b76ff69f3ad00e2570c919b5a9ac5e0a6f5","a26f7f5db9b3ab42a50d34a3e7d647e40001d9a9","64f831e2c89c16647397200356b8978a8e56d68b","d962f937ebab6e4b544b6a72f82659c14286a9e6","a9946ce1eae9cb37246333c4ccd5fc1f464a85e5","d15cf97fd3e59c4f75a71ba2d3f258e7f47a5ea4","2f8cfa219250b69adbe4cc65eba8dd8ce72c6f59","5ec0935333b2cb3a952468f90a49192965ece19b","75a15923d1ac488a06dc1845154e05614e33b6e6","715ae6dd71ce5ec45200953cf2bccdc5d2df1b04","24599b7cd74c703729fd6deb3c41aa9c405c4f7c","72da1d14e77880b24c8c7db014a8ebabb69eaf03","29a776559eaade15103e17cc4cca5e89687a49f5","2b9a139d2ad1e79cb0c64d245fb5f7bc723fedac","8068e97a75a2ab74e0cae85b02577a0b2b522b90","80f3af7df3fddb08b12c2886009a1e50c0d85fa0","9e4e40c91b508776a85b314a9ab2b5c6483dcb36","712d566b2cb240ac107390f076f63c5a9d86f8cf","599ffddff8c36a0b2f23075cb234a82bb9fcea09"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.du.edu/~sazghand/background_chap_papers/A%20framework%20for%20evaluating%20regression%20test%20selection%20techniques.pdf","http://web.cs.du.edu/~sazghand/background_chap_papers/A%20framework%20for%20evaluating%20regression%20test%20selection%20techniques.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257767","http://cse.unl.edu/~grother/papers/icse94.ps.gz","http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aristotle/Publications/Papers/icse94.ps"],"title":"A Framework for Evaluating Regression Test Selection Techniques","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The past also includes successful histories. If you haven't been made aware of them, you're often condemned not to repeat their successes.In a rapidly expanding field such as software engineering, this happens a lot. Extensive studies of many software projects such as the Standish Reports offer convincing evidence that many projects fail to repeat past successes.This paper tries to identify at least some of the major past software experiences that were well worth repeating, and some that were not. It also tries to identify underlying phenomena influencing the evolution of software engineering practices that have at least helped the author appreciate how our field has gotten to where it has been and where it is.A counterpart Santayana-like statement about the past and future might say, \"In an era of rapid change, those who repeat the past are condemned to a bleak future.\" (Think about the dinosaurs, and think carefully about software engineering maturity models that emphasize repeatability.)This paper also tries to identify some of the major sources of change that will affect software engineering practices in the next couple of decades, and identifies some strategies for assessing and adapting to these sources of change. It also makes some first steps towards distinguishing relatively timeless software engineering principles that are risky not to repeat, and conditions of change under which aging practices will become increasingly risky to

Besides, frameworks should also take into account several quality attributes. Therefore, framework development practices typically involve considerable efforts. This would indicate that some aspects of the domain could not be directly modeled in terms of object-oriented concepts. The problem is how to break the tradeoffs imposed by a pure functional decomposition versus a pure object-oriented decomposition of a system.","inCitations":["44a83b6d4a3f3e53a058d0e5241f74ae9c431e9d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581468","http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/10915/21502/Documento_completo.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"An object-oriented bridge among architectural styles, aspects and frameworks","doi":"10.1145/581339.581468","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581468","venue":"ICSE"}

Most of them lose the ability to form any valid conclusions or analyses in the presence of even a single inconsistency.\nThis forces our programs to operate in terms of an idealized model rather than the real world with the attendant requirement to either maintain a mapping between the two or force human operators to resolve the inconsistencies before the data is processed by the idealized system.\nMy \"Tolerating Inconsistency paper introduced a simple way to scope formal constraint systems so that they applied only to the consistent data.

Principles taught include a modular style of software development, an emphasis on human understanding of component behavior even while using formal specifications, and the importance of maintainability, as well as classical issues such as efficiency analysis and reasoning. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of student outcomes and end-to-end changes in student attitudes show mostly positive results that are statistically significant, confirming that (1) it is possible to teach CBSE principles without displacing \"classical principles usually taught in introductory courses, (2) students can understand and reuse formally-specified components without knowing their implementations, and (3) student attitudes towards software engineering can be altered in directions heretofore often assumed to be difficult to achieve.","inCitations":["0e83ffe4aa3a65e5761dcdabc3b9dcc9cd2aa693","df5c03b3ca69aaf9dab19465daae7e367be9d257","1243d56328f05025a78187a607aaee3ce595037c","c6b8060e8900760fd3f007c3128e8fdee40ba766","82ceb3f2e72243538a6aa8bff1a60070bdeca4e1","9c82814c991526cd1b6677f677e08685aff7aaec","8c6c33f178e0c9774892d0cd26562b375190e8a7","692f6e3fb968a5e52bd5e9d48c217aa448ebff16","02940ca76348d78527c4d172e602c3a2046546cc","1dd08ef2f7c72c7adea98a6fbd98a906a8da27e4","372bcecdcae15ba876921d2e54f0eef40efa14ec","32b0343ad001a28093cf3f9c7f97c408edcd45e1","5e8bdf9318e9e1df2bee03bd14ce5fe130e29ad9","9e9d80f2de9e749dcde0fe76599ea654d4776007","050112f5f3b904197d8479a7ec49d4102d8e4d22","c39204123ea21eb0bdf90876ad74690c6acd2b3a","3bd5646f5daad17fda6eaf4d9b1b99926bcb86cd","1d57ef9be1f9d51d26ccde69ec091997b584cc6c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~weide/rsrg/documents/2001/01SLWHW.pdf","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/rsrg/sce/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/web/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~weide/sce/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919134","http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~weide/sce/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/rsrg/documents/2001/01SLWHW.pdf","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~weide/rsrg/sce/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/sce/papers/evaluation-paper/evaluation-paper.pdf","http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~weide/rsrg/documents/2001/01SLWHW.pdf"],"title":"A Formal Approach to Component-Based Software Engineering: Education and Evaluation","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919134","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919134","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper presents a system which automatically monitors programmer activities, and we propose a programmer debugging performance measure based on data monitored by the system. The system automatically categorizes programmer activity in real time into three types (compilation, program execution, and program modification) by moniton”ng and analyzing key strokes of a programmer. The resulting outputs are the time sequences of monitored activities. The measure we propose is the average length of debugging time per fault, D, estimated from the data sequences monitored by the system. To esiimate the debugging time per fault, we introduce a testing and debugging process model. The process model has parameters associated with the average length of a program modification d, and the probability of a fault being fixed completely by a program modification, r. By taking account of r as well as d, the debugging time per fault can be estimated with high accuracy. The model parameters, such as d and r, are computed from the monitored data sequences by using a maximum likelihood estimation method.","inCitations":["8479aef3055e40c894105a51a59614890ee4d7d1","277c2523a95ad55b2388039c6bad8d1e957b3bc0","1e0da0c621660915560b7102f613e117f10a39dd"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257752"],"title":"A Programmer Performance Measure Based on Programmer State Transitions in Testing and Debugging Process","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

PROMPTER adopts object-oriented approach and represents both hardware and programming knowledge as class/instance definitions. Object-oriented representation helps decompose the knowledge and organize it in a hierarchical way. It is shown that most of conventions such as data definitions which are the major obstacles to understanding system programs can be well formalized in this framework.","inCitations":["2dbfb626e1aebd2bde3aebcd0ef2d14f6d5cbe5b","571f8d2054b34ae5322f450ca6b44570f80bbff5"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319670"],"title":"PROMPTER: A Knowledge Based Support Tool for Code Understanding","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Research has provided evidence that it may not always be practical, feasible, or cost-effective to eliminate certain clone groups through refactoring. This paper describes CloneTracker, an Eclipse plug-in that provides support for tracking code clones in evolving software. With CloneTracker, developers can specify clone groups they wish to track, and the tool will automatically generate a clone model that is robust to changes to the source code, and can be shared with other collaborators of the project. When future modifications intersect with tracked clones, CloneTracker will notify the developer, provide support to consistently apply changes to a corresponding clone region, and provide support for updating the clone model. CloneTracker complements existing techniques by providing support for reusing knowledge about the location of clones in source code, and support for keeping track of clones when refactoring is not desirable.","inCitations":["f3b4eb3f5ae5628a2bc567926ca7b3bd415975b7","2164ad90ed4e7d2f4de901651cfaf76a97714555","25a7b8e1dc2a46c2f6885f4096ae3168fc852660","975707860f1a340f90773c55ee1f2cec20845fac","b61fce23eaf1ccc326eed073def039809bcfbdad","3c81e82d6a8ea2b3102cc4ebe7fefbcdcd6e3cb5","75b6ef481e08c194962a6f97472f30efc894ef40","d3e4e89c29421d2d9a6b136f14aa2968331a99ed","15f7963a8110f787069cc8c0a569291f62c2f183","9d95073a8fc1754fe37a2d6f7489180a0752aa09","1d4e523999cdb9a41969f31d3765ee1e8f65bf90","524853059a54e6de7d693260262397f83f16d061","9ec3d860dfaddbb07f6c9d31f5294520f7bb5217","a6e17eb16d6c864c5d68f5eb1efc444d827f8a3c","df7c1d72837dd41671944089c14f982cdb331f79","3de97712b1259fdd4dbf5d9fe4dd8bec7b3b7949","86dfd89f322c83b6375e74a20636aa0a38a69d82","a681b08ccf7c1876b055f49c63f73591c406e633","a093f118396e8fdef7da7ac31b85baba27c2a163","09da20c2374abf0cba0f535d1f721642cc8bacc5","ca7588aff6bf1f1bbd68bc2b9b71c7455b0b52b2","9b287ba9a1b848fafeb9def8271e85eb9cd09ab7","7f069ac5897dbe9d16b7edeb2efd056fe0fbd58e","504d9c0585b028154fd992870578ae190b969c9c","540d4f130e931c8407bd8c5f295ae2188ab0bf3c","3bf0628eb67e1b9dc55333cce8365fc00771b8d2","8829639bff661c2314521fe9ed3d3a91b36ac0f4","264fbb0550daa9d730eb5c1ec7f1a41444f4f345","44d5011ae4bfa359c70a8e23b8e447dece69bbb1","b408be510724e11f1403223a135afd3625df8749","222e40669ac4f17cdc77e53c19988ffa6d417ddf","49e8fc25bdb7e7e277c572b9fd24cd9711c1c457","33a7d99877594045b3127db2ede0a0ddd31d8fc1","9d84034f8775c1df77652d6bc9114e2f56b4fc8c","255204f9bb5c91f34ed32198c7f048a4df4f046c","1f1e03e84239be3c0b27d6adf4f003aa09971a34","d29a94f8aa25a217e2afe4f0bb240eb8db47a160","0ee146968b6bb56ba4d4f57adb78777fbb024505","3ca0bb6421cdd259813f2f475632e9f13d82c4a3","b22f0746a9a415676a5776fcdc2a27c859617a7c","c13861058eb7361dd3984f4e44666235184beea7","5703cc8d61418ab3c679ed22fdc1f00ee3343ead","62522029cfba8dcfd45c24c0817d21c7b54c537c","4b7ca39262c19a366da58d00af7ad4b915738197","e6da872bb242bf6fc9c44647649ad85e1281201b","fcddbc90f45037c91e3aeeb4a214c81536e89764","3a6947d111287c4e928df2bc0ea625c5b96a5947","e26264524d2a0c9a154f4c2e4f1ae5b71adc0de1","8e3ffec56da6184ed9a96e2eee491effc351b48a","16d943487c21773be2009fc82be0310ddae1d225","193ebc326a0416fe051780103a83ccacb5b3ee60","5efa9b72e4209bf5911abe47234203772d4e5708","e87bd7e6e392ff6ce7144372da422b91b020b702"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368218"],"title":"Clonetracker: tool support for code clone management","doi":"10.1145/1368088.1368218","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1368088.1368218","venue":"ICSE"}

Up to now, most estimates have been done subjectively by experts. These estimates are often inaccurate. In the midst of development, faulty estimates may contribute to delays and/or excess expenses.\n In the last several years, several estimation have been proposed, most of which were models to estimate software development cost {manpower). These models used program size as a variable. However at the beginning of development, when estimations are made, program sizes are usually uncertain and costs (manpower) are equally uncertain.\n The authors developed a program-size estimation model for batch programs in a banking system, and used the model in an actual project. Using the adapted model, estimation errors amounted to only 7 percent. This is much better than the accuracy of estimtions made by experts in the field (usually about 10 percent accuracy), and indicates that objective estimation methods can be derived for program-size.\n In this paper, we introduce our estimation model and discuss the adaptation of that model for a specific project.","inCitations":["cdad9b07690fd52ad5e3a835c3d4d4ece07c41fc","19509249abbc1f9d430bff5e370f647bc0fbf94b","c01d10b650870607515a6a9e216ecd6fec55f988","050141436555e29662d891db06d149715d230e97","12e4522c85251dd4c6cea6c9381a9ab328b1d2d0","b7237b75dac745cd9642faeeaac823ba89c4acd1","12a9abd6bae928f1f4eeac1b363b5b23428875e5","362b351c2de2663705be3f2a08b66a7514c99907","8dfa972ab1135505fa2d0e00f4b17df8e49f7557","1e7cffda57ee045e82bda748dd63c3d570464fa9","305575edfe87261a7d04d36ea62a38ed1f3cc740","79502d6691601a4400b43830a1ebb6ef2da5300d"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807752"],"title":"A Model for Estimating Program Size and Its Evaluation","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Scheduling a software project is extremely difficult, though, because the time needed to complete a software development activity is hard to estimate. Often, the completion of a task is delayed because of unanticipated rework caused by feedback between activities in the process. In this research demo, we show how to use process simulation to support software project managers in scheduling. We present a discrete-time simulator tailored to software projects which explicitly takes a scheduling strategy as input. The simulator makes it easy to experiment with different scheduling strategies. It provides quick feedback about the impact that a particular strategy is likely to have on the progress and completion time of a project. A manager can compare different strategies and choose the strategy which he thinks is best for the next project's setting. In addition, a single step mode of the simulator allows a manager to view the dynamics of a project in detail. The simulator is an implementation of the probabilistic scheduling model for software projects which we have presented earlier [6, 8]. The scheduling model describes the software process at a high level of abstraction: teams work on software components. Classical process phases such as coding or testing are not modeled explicitly. Still, the model captures much of the dynamics of software projects, representing varying staff skill levels, rework caused by design changes, component coupling, and changing task assignments. Process simulation is an important technique to evaluate the impact of proposed process changes [5]. In particular, system dynamics simulations have been around for years, some of them addressing the problem of project staffing [1, 2]. By modeling individual teams and components as well as explicit task assignments, our model is much more fine-grained than system dynamics models. In addition, the particular way in which our model describes feedback between activities is novel in both software engineering and operations research [ 3, 7, 9].","inCitations":["4e806a7a22aede0da412a32af97ae79c59309da9","45bc2db1c90091b3f87e9dc2da70cd7d10de132b","36753d465ca73d7fe53d8ffa20d885757517604b","9f222c747762b8cdb048611009af955e5f69e267","d532e386bea1faba6b6dda19e6b24682c635f435","e087a7f85ed63fe985bc58c8a2a1c0d7846240e5","2e06bf6d1b065328c6e6e7ce03f4d189a4fd521e","4c36cdddd07d1f53d2d604f5959f66f4b19fc33b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ipd.kit.edu/Tichy/uploads/publikationen/34/icse03.pdf","http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~tichy/uploads/publikationen/34/icse03.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776966"],"title":"A Software Process Scheduling Simulator","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

It is used to estimate the effort required for the software development. However, it has been reported that since function point measurement involves judgment on the part of the measurer, differences for the same product may occur even in the same organization. Also, if an organization tries to introduce FPA, FP will have to be measured from the past software developed there, and this measurement is cost-consuming. In this paper, we intend to examine the possibility to measure FP from source code automatically. At first, we propose measurement rules to count data and transactional functions for object-oriented program based on IFPUG method and develop the function point measurement tool. Then, we have applied the tool to practical Java programs in a computer company and examined the difference between the FP values obtained by the tool and those of an FP measurement specialist. As the results, the number of data and transactional functions extracted by the tool is similar to ones by the specialist though for the classification of each function there is some difference between them.","inCitations":["8cb03d827c1ee20257fadac54796e6efd7407872","fce99c67719373b063edb35b67aea055befef276","b6ad94264d8e2b852972839d64fbd8f2d2eada38","309e06170f4e83546dd74b0a691d1f43025100af","21951d9441e16d2d2856f979cdfbae90de56c1a5","bcef785963f8bc876b5569a892685f4efcb76c0f","e5cbf33749d5fc6c816cdf67421261ed689980f2","4375fa5528a9062c7ed478876786164d3fb5f364","7ed398f141266bc7aeab9b130e2b6073262125ba","22e3abe67601d5e6cdb54992050fe8aef956ced6","7558427ad1febf852b7828aad4aa2e799726d212","128819da52b0103c5be9a8f7ffcc7f11cd397476","b321b740292cba468311c1c665d138eac9fd197e","84f76392e7df9c3abf93a3557556c58cfe9abc12"],"pdfUrls":["http://iip-lab.ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/~lab-db/betuzuri/archive/370/370.pdf","http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~lab-db/betuzuri/archive/370/370.pdf","http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/lab-db/betuzuri/archive/370/370.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581412"],"title":"Function point measurement from Java programs","doi":"10.1145/581339.581412","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581412","venue":"ICSE"}

Early environments provided support for small fragments of the software process (usually focusing on programming-in-the small). Then there was a trend towards support for more complete software processes (from early phases like requirements analysis and design down to testing and configuration management). Ten years ago the notion of process-centered software engineering environments initiated a new field in software engineering: software process research. The key idea was to use a model of a software process as input parameter for a software engineering environment. The environment was supposed to “behave” in accordance to the process model. Some aspects of this vision became true, others turned out to be of little practicability.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Volker_Gruhn2/publication/221554131_Process-Centered_Software_Engineering_Environments_Academic_and_Industrial_Perspectives/links/00b49519a0e6f4c758000000.pdf","https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/2001/1050/00/10500671b.pdf"],"title":"Process-Centered Software Engineering Environments: Academic and Industrial Perspectives","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The open nature of Android allows users to install miscellaneous applications, including the malicious ones, from third-party marketplaces without rigorous sanity checks. A large portion of existing malwares perform stealthy operations such as sending short messages, making phone calls and HTTP connections, and installing additional malicious components. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect such stealthy behavior. We model stealthy behavior as the program behavior that mismatches with user interface, which denotes the user's expectation of program behavior. We use static program analysis to attribute a top level function that is usually a user interaction function with the behavior it performs. Then we analyze the text extracted from the user interface component associated with the top level function. Semantic mismatch of the two indicates stealthy behavior. To evaluate AsDroid, we download a pool of 182 apps that are potentially problematic by looking at their permissions. Among the 182 apps, AsDroid reports stealthy behaviors in 113 apps, with 28 false positives and 11 false negatives.","inCitations":["65f4487c5aedd61fc05e5c605eb9fbea5940c2cd","29a22b26fa61f26fee1a07ae2041be0fb21754aa","4727dd478166d5ba48e9edb60ffdc24d55d48a1b","bcf7e4ed5dec67f6b7f292535917158aa99dab03","3f1176bbedc54dcdb9c92cdc5797d1da9f13c802","22c4761a3b1761294f17954d6545947698f17801","42d22a1d226a473f48d71bee76494efee3cbb0ed","f0351ef5684cee27dc0d28ed2134c94a6d2ef23e","a43a656437b09e90f8e232179957c0f52a0693b3","ebb1b0b223cae6014ef4470e64fd337291a2796a","34e8e4dbde847f30691abc124eb967b706dc8980","a6624c872d8aa5fe14a706048cf258a440f0564a","37e3aa13c0f37e9cb26eb8a8ee5bc86de5dcedb5","116e047cb9076bfd95139c00680f1114f4f5fa15","e69617e8dc92e23e3dfb8517bebd4118acde25a2","354a89cada16c0b968f454ca6d20a20ab5a27e39","3efc4f4389b551aecc06738550d16f11f53f21fb","9715d3f69c30240e2f66616ad0f29fd3b8f3e157","801d1da510b60d5e61e3ecd41f66f4fc441b5de9","128ceb2003ffb109e5ea3df48eb404a0c3f40788","971c566f33446adbf7e3e0ad578f3e717252c36a","8bb45e2fb38c7d2f4e4e714baa19bd7f73c4fb25","a0d5c4bf0778961dd2c2e9642bd4f62d83bd113f","78b86f8646c603cb61550e7e4ada9b5b8be72ccb","a56d7e83042f77fdf8b72ff7f831122cb9b75048","4043fbc795bf3c93885040e4a5edff223e848c2b","b680eda8bcd12212fe447faf04fd0295dc7dbfd1","0d1ac6c638ed298b1600607a5c406021dccfa5c5","959093db69abc3b0fb4f7acc696a7f6ef39d0e23","048c6deac1c35d29dfdf2b75b15980c533f156e6","89fae4cefaefddcf61bb1f074bf2cddc38ca1f49","45674ab89637524d50f4fd232c9c4983a91c9968","5ed3d046db630fdee559df6f6f7c710a80dc7c41","297ac4306022c4bda3a20a656accf1a73563ef86","b20ed8fe63f66c25b6173efb6cf95c940b2c84a8","460b82ede28e2304b63d8145cf87e2b10a97ba24","0db4f8a69cb2644d5eee542e14cd607e0c484f4e","abdf8c1109dc16bd1c8aef9f4d298283f24f41e4","9c1d985b8ba26935631a0dc389fb3526d7a0cc2f","f9de687d1d04171cb84937b4cdb4fa1a64070971","e0f8b3db54651099005bf1debdd1da8047953e98","8a6d38b9103bb2526fa41a7a58b529ac0db1ed34","ced1313acaacd3897b5b231cdccb1383d01d20c4","0bc929100284d7a162a177fbfc521e97507ee056","c279ab612db467f6d934a707c58c98b610288ae8","080f1f7a903ba3d77f0f21a3a89bd2db0d958e46","46a61677fe781f4ecfba29e12bfff85c40e24c27","4ac725657c76d69a0915222cfbb74341af21d128","aa652ce3084e8de9bdaf32940c8e1592da055830","0a174f2da1d1ce20fb42685919433537b8a469e5","a69302da25703c5d6547f8fa46e07be1d8a3c086","c8c8ee6d82ae40c743c0981e74031943a9ca5af0","613136dd79e9cba1755a468cfcc0253d9dcbba8f","33c19ae3c785d161651b012173a26c399fa12078","f37566fa1c54e230d47d54d27c4b6941c16f5e74","58bbe5ca035e139d37a8023e0b477a337fb592fa","7f8d45c4f17a68b1ddb5fa0a1a01cd58539f2371","00d04c78bc2c3e57727b1489987ae39bbd8127e6","0940f25680b71c9d6421aafaa8a937a7f21a4e90","87d94ebacb51f8b6e810eea5193fb192b4f59dda","45616dd3a1d171ffd072f37be2c82f91598b825b","30c7daed94dcf51c33624c2f9d4f9d4175f555a6","ef5b65654aff0dc4f4391c0c7a4f71fb0fa4065f","4a4c0cfc26020d519679a98fe683fce6aab1eefa","665954c53b57e2a808d2d67f0cbfc5442da198d0","2d7dc80fee1f0d0ad307d7e2afc888f0f1954384","9eff64234a0acfe87404328027bd65c9ccd97431","a54e5957b5f27f15cfc4967a33f92decbff31e0b","3ebed9a596557f606829f8d97a594ed924c434b3","89019f46a5079258be0d425a8ea0c3239d5c1424","210172be2d03442030ed7f6d57ca48e3386b03e2","05a5702d7853499236b50258e26fa36a3b4c9c98","2a2769bff9a6e289970721e6fb7c3872a1bacb43","2b0df36c661362c8e6bddd71e331d2203fc97cf1","0977d449c684ccaabd722d09d7b15a1c68030449","4d4d1300f44261f91c5436eb3f717c65047bc8ba","54edba0216308e34634a224f79aba38dd4f8fe72","64297dbe7df15356b1e5c0b143ecb741c4ed0ad2","ce31ed2f26be0e2b153c5fad6ebc0fa42e2a6386","81f3537221e3c033d215fb4205aa3203d1ce6045","5c308003ed2be30ed6b616a2a477970c5dd126c0","1e2d469c6df82526d1c6d2eca5de95b8525e1c41","dbb1362284dfc176412092913f685e0d193cc934","3a0927a0c5ace022bd9a510f9e1f9440bec8352c","51948240e4191179ce76a6dab4a6a28e36e18aa4","b4edd916b08f85d696d9addd8b0b1901c41a3ade","258d04671ca93b2bcc515cd2436760c54d164470","1b51a0d3e7da280cad0057f596adf7fb1048d60f","39861b52b52cc2a7f9e574560052f39197e51111","f502807d90e3e60d0421bf71484c2079913d2f4b","525d6ae933a3fd48706da668b9e09fe2d1592d37","2aebaafe66d10044336aa7b593f50e2e49ca5245","cfc13e6658f0386931a95dd308985969248a8763","9ad3d22e467fc1e06109940ddd862f2570c0ecfd","c16c80416c64ea2f1a9f2a18c503011c5d6574b1","da4158479c5dfbedf1ecb7b784953325236fce29","4a06b4ddac04970a58d332637855df69cf935596","a983c1332958a9de4bd46b111848c541dc463b84","1a6218a174f5be297cfa4a16fd52a1b814ac4261","e8747236efad53c3de02f3aeff880b361eb25a1a","f328b2458b09c58d08a966d91b7a56f1beb50524","9985263282b833410ab9d3bf8632077f0e33dd0a","a335fc988e4c36055e44356ad6fdcdc9e62ecb10","78951b4e7f03a40e1ee8b827786d878b47116926","2de93fc2044d0d7445a5ecc5c1414252b3526cdb","de2a57c4171a52cfe431aad84bb407c3dd610675","1fe3c451b28a595624202d4e9cce4cc681c5594a","cb2c9c9abbcbfb7b8365ed712d5e65ebcfe3117b","48e6d7a903a9506dad55ae0d2828f6c80278e39e","50749186978deefcae8e528dcf4b3c5b7d9e5ba3","d24bc60c2bb5c0f0d51312538bcf20bb7b262e70","18c4a40db5af5d0f1d9d068335a867272f813311","0339584e6c0b073e2f62383a7a76d448766143f1","d491c72aa7958f09503bd470f55bfcd861be2efc","6050ec7f45e6a9d11549b977be896b01081731ec","270ed42d9eca94894043cf4101d

The development of these tools is itself a significant software engineering task, requiring a considerable investment of time and resources. There are a large number of different kinds of automated software engineering tool, variously known as Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE), Computer Aided Method Engineering (CAME), Integrated Project Support Environments (IPSE), Software Engineering Environments (SEE), and meta-CASE tools. Although these tools differ in the particular methods, activities, and phases of the software development cycle to which they are applied, constructors of these tools often face similar implementation issues. Decisions about host computing platform, implementation language, conformance with standards and reference models, choice of repository, integration and interoperability mechanisms, and user interface style have to be made. The different strategies adopted by tool constructors when solving these tool development problems is the theme of this symposium.","inCitations":["1276bfc9d7f796b66cf95b7d5940dc8df09b035e"],"pdfUrls":["https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&context=infopapers&httpsredir=1&referer=","https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337822"],"title":"The Second International Symposium on Constructing Software Engineering Tools (CoSET2000)","doi":"10.1145/337180.337822","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337822","venue":"ICSE"}

In particular, our emphasis lies in transformation technology, wherein user-invoked source-to-source transformations are applied to the partitioned system for the purpose of optimizing the transactions required to effect the distributed behavior. In this way, the application downloading system need only produce a correct partitioning of the original program, not an efficient one. The user, with system guidance, optimizes the partitioned program by applying transformations chosen from the system library. Thus, application downloading can be viewed as a narrow domain in which to apply the transformation technology we have developed elsewhere in a broader context(1).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802558"],"title":"Application Downloading","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Design patterns address these shortcomings by capturing the expertise that is necessary for reusable design solutions. However, there is so far no methodical approach to providing these conceptual design building blocks in a tangible and composable form. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of design components, reified design patterns fit for software composition. In this paper, we define design components and explain their constituents and services. Furthermore, we detail the activities of design composition and illustrate them as a process within a four-dimensional design space. Moreover, we describe a prototype of a design composition environment. A case study helps illustrating our approach.","inCitations":["ac1aaf8e690c8d6d66dcb8514f135a3d42090a7f","853ac7a831f7734c15f6b5a9d37d44ce5cae3688","c4438841f871adc9ab297a53a016db10b8c9d9cb","6b28deb4385cdb5df1cdab1e0525a57c71d89bae","a6b813fe886971125ae993e62b525398e298a2da","26c3621d132554c8f7b5a04cd9f577ee06854ef6","87909f9262e70a786038086ca0f8a7e9b7216181","fa2a0ecf236164d19c5da8dc45d72c2014bc1eff","a141061633869d7ac0b7910494f7d41804f830c3","d6a53504943d7f59931fe75cd38bd710551bb5d1","53eddf228f16e199b81974a80bd816934e737bdb","559e22d08f2dbf80b8855b475294784c09ebe926","bd321b2880621bb0e73cdd3a22a24caba1c47dcf","d11015f6abab2a1c4c2cff2687059c3d37de5d9a","4524a6a9a74687bebd6257bd38ddfe1957006291","d9f044c074eb34b478a2affca91b9b6aefd89641","e47003e312afd36b65ee2e1f369e175b817a3557","1e84c17cf92c490014f4391e11c89303ed37b794","46d005f0dfcc105e59e4be3ee3adab9dac1e14e6","05f847f337bb9823a353b7ad768c9ade09d9a0eb","3a3eb10bc3411e57d71ecc989c75ab7053666591","546c81e4493e405324d8fd3f8b7b64dcfeb0e6a0","c0873012ba193d16f97b438fa36d06906c448583","0682b0faa4c67e230896eea5f7cd959705982c34","02491c0c852dd57652d13a10cf3ce8e0ccc2cd48","21b2ff00abaabe7cc58f7a960a87490d807b27fe","998ba39c2a0ad5d10aa239a4349cdda35d4cdcae","500adbb1aa85b6b0b2fdd4900bea2c1b37976fce","afb8976d7c45c8f45ea78034676480217b75f2fa","adc73f33e7c523fc584358d58afedb78a5c30ca5","b668acc629c40d47efa656dfd12ff159be7b8b91","88a4408a3ec14fe7c77c34f5c1c7bce76e5dbc4d","860599406bcb03f4056219821f5128a09402a6f2","1a99d07e223e53a5cbe1c3924d5676de30c273fc","2c3fce637ec8ac7e4fc2d87cb6a43d46afeffb85","90816f39a2a5cd439eac5e85c4190848ae91f71f","1a2849633e5e2500bc92bc835eda89c366b16e19","33b008a63a2e83e656eb074ca4c57cf8f474c92c","b924879653765654382c350a0bf17c37836d0345","0c6be693a77969bf1fa93ca37cc014396d167220","675d7cf7065bddb5f711191aaca53c1675f09032","fd961a2d6390c15b85f619eab3a81eaa5cd1c632","ba2b1c9c92725d61dfacab8221e5dad4e9c3ac99","0432adf3dd5f6ed980dbb013c007ecb700850e0e","c25c4e839780f038ebcad33eb21c12320074b37b","841cad2db6ca8c7f600302a1847476e20b117c4f","2e602b4dab8b53a80fef0aaee735bbe17b3b9a71","050030ca8f34d1797cede6b38d809d8735b6031f","36f1994e5041f02a2f7d1abb869a348d3a3d20c1","10d4deb768311c86c36112ef763352d7c4623615","dc936db24197131f471f1ce5586fcc8ac8ce78fe","ff03f91d328fd7d7a0531cc60fda76daefee17eb","f33f4c831734472fbe054144cf85a18cedd0180b","7dbcc6835ce2581d617e0b7516a5606d7957c645","53a20d57d59285972c2cd3dd1ca700e8b0ea6423","4756bceb0736ef08d352cbd43b77aa60e446388c","9fb62a71cc0af4deb0d04356c95a3436090de8d2","4dfb6a7d358b8bc5cd08ced55ac37f7215575046","dfa718ab4c160377d17fa4a1382cb5167549e758","8a36367aee4870578a1dd52ca8c64c2600a42f48","fbd0cfc0a9e4ba705550448e5476f525ce67e959","3280b7ececbe688dc2be03408eb18a621030ce2c","22bf86be7cf9b8047a7809134d3f92b1f7ecad9f"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671356","http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~keller/Publications/Papers/icse98.pdf","http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~keller/cgi-bin/tracking/Papers/ax.cgi?http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~keller/Publications/Papers/icse98.pdf"],"title":"Design Components: Towards Software Composition at the Design Level","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671356","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671356","venue":"ICSE"}

This investigation looks into the various aspects of designing and developing an Environmental Information System (EIS) using Object Technology and in the process identifying new, generic and specific design patterns which can be used in developing object oriented frameworks for the environment domain. EIS’s deal with data associated with a phenomena or process at some location on the earth and represented in spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude, height or depth), and at some point in time represented in temporal coordinates (day, month, year, hour, minutes). Large volumes of heterogeneous data are currently available for monitoring and forecasting the environment. These data come from different sensors that have different resolutions in space and time, come in different formats and measure different parameters. Users need to use these data singly or in combination (synergetitally), as well as share and exchange them on a regional, national and/or international level. Data collected over land differ from data collected from the marine environment. Problems specific to data from the marine environment such as manipulation of 4D data, irregular sampling on one or more dimensions and specialized processing requirements make a general purpose Geegraphic Information System (GIS) inappropriate for the task. For land based EIS on the other hand, an off-theshelf GIS may be well suited for both processing and presentation of data, but for marine applications there will be some facilities which are not part of a COTS tool. Thus a framework for EIS, allowing components to be added as needed will be useful in the development of IS’s for terrestrial or marine applications.

A user should be able to include the data, processing tools and models that suit his/her requirements best, while excluding others. Further, it should be possible to use legacy systems with as little modification as possible. By representing the system components viz. data sets, tools and models as objects, it is possible to develop a flexible Environmental Information System which can be easily extended and with a high degree of portability. Additional benefits of using the object oriented paradigm include design and code reuse, which in turn lead to reduced maintenance costs.. An initial study of three different scenarios within the environment domain has been undertaken to identify the processes and parameters relevant for monitoring the environment and for identifying functionalities within the domain. The three scenarios included are the Marine Information System, the Ground Water Information System and an Acoustic Information System. Even though the data requirements, data processing and modeling requirements were vastly different for the three scenarios, some of the basic functionalities were found to be the same. All the ISs required the data to undergo some pre-processing; these data had to be visualized for subjective verification and some of the data were used in models for monitoring and forecasting purposes. By abstracting the common functionalities on a high level, it was found that the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework architecture was applicable to the IS design as it divided the interactive application into three communicating components. Frameworks for data mangement, data processing and data visualization were common to all the scenarios. By further refining the high level architecture, smaller and simpler frameworks were identified. While frameworks for some components, such as for Graphical User Interface already exist in syome form, others are being developed externally, such as those for data storage and data management.

To maintain or manage code clones, developers often have to investigate differences of multiple cloned code fragments. However,existing program differencing techniques compare only two code fragments at a time. Developers then have to manually combine several pairwise differencing results. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances. We have implemented our approach as an Eclipse plugin and evaluated its accuracy with three Java software systems. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm has precision over 97.66% and recall over 95.63% in three open source Java projects. We also conducted a user study of 18 developers to evaluate the usefulness of our approach for eight clone-related refactoring tasks. Our study shows that our approach can significantly improve developers’performance in refactoring decisions, refactoring details, and task completion time on clone-related refactoring tasks. Automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances also opens opportunities for building practical applications of code clones in software maintenance, such as auto-generation of application skeleton, intelligent simultaneous code editing.","inCitations":["4bc80b8f39cf4f73137e8e804712ad20d7e18088","7cb528fd5621bbc0a70ff849a7c5cceaeea5bb3b","acb5942773aeae239f12cf268afd61bfb950bc0f","d3e4e89c29421d2d9a6b136f14aa2968331a99ed","7815a46fbe103d4f50b0c54cbfcf0010ded5fbad","40c07bfd50050baf962e2b86d52e511e430e27ab","9d84034f8775c1df77652d6bc9114e2f56b4fc8c","f70f37c4f3bfc4e9010a4bb36734927b06377ca8","4a2d53d4879d024e2803e266dfeaaf8cd1298b74","c2834b153786952eedf238ff127e1bbaf26067be","f6b0d7beccd3de3e3b6e01ecf68039b94f56d3f1","6ed8c38bef1b91ff3e0b5a8fc2ba734c8b8ffc8d","287cf79cb79635108f7fed99a9509e303466db14","e46ac00dfcdf0e7f4717c6e7439194687f271360","aca599500909d09d931d6c1de803b19673589dfb","30339f6164e5ffe3ab2cd00df926f42fdddf0bb6","dc7ce50bc11992232613d67dbfae92dbb785daa4","1cb3b0ca46cee332123f0c84976e01990254ad09","76e0778b651509741d2e4816f633bf8b00acf006","8f3f2b007e1b2705e6430824ffb13b5b95d24f15","877b40649c0528413994dfd1e108436032c51ac1","87230ed9c8801a8cc5233e09fcf3e3246b14e2df","a7d90cebd279de78687bb8e58b832c1badd9967e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568298","http://www.se.fudan.edu.cn/paper/icse2014-lin-mcidiff.pdf","http://www.se.fudan.edu.cn/paper/ourpapers/234.pdf"],"title":"Detecting differences across multiple instances of code clones","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568298","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568298","venue":"ICSE"}

Subsequently, we consider k-connected networks with regular nodes (of low degree) containing also a set of “advanced” (“central”) nodes (of higher, though appropriately bounded) degree. Corresponding extremal k-connected topologies which guarantee every regular node to be within a prescribed distance from the center (being the set of central nodes), and to include a minimal center size, are derived.

Not only does this aid uniformity, but of course it also offers economic leverage.\nControl of the environment resides in the kernel and it is not possible for tools to ignore the controls and prejudice the integrity of the project data.\nSharing is achieved because the project data and its structure reside in the database which is under the control of the kernel.\nEarly efforts to build such an IPSE were based on the STONEMAN model, where the kernel was the KAPSE. The crucial interface in this architecture is the KAPSE interface, which offers services to all tools. We did not sufficiently realise, however, that there is a major economic problem in designing a new interface from scratch. All tools which are to be used in an environment must, by definition, conform to this interface definition. This means that all the tools have to be specially written to use the new interface, and it became apparent that no single organisation could or should expect to provide a complete new tool kit in this way. Rather one wants an open market in software tools, in the same way that it is hoped Ada will lead to an open market in software components. The more recent history of IPSE efforts, therefore, has been an attempt to resolve the conflict between the desire for integration and the need for environments to accept a wide range of tools from various sources.\n Perhaps the most ambitious project taking this approach is ASPECT, a project within the UK Alvey programme, which is currently delivering prototypes for evaluation. ASPECT aims to provide a highly functional Open Tool Interface covering coherence, control and sharing. It does this by treating the Open Tool Interface as a special case of an adaptable interface which provides user-defined views of the underlying kernel.

This is especially important since most dynamically allocated objects are stored in containers.The tool is based on the concept of object ownership: every object has one and only one owning pointer. The owning pointer holds the exclusive right and obligation to either delete the object or to transfer the obligation. This paper presents a new type system that allows different instances of a polymorphic container to hold different types of elements, and to independently own or not own their elements.Our tool is sound: it will report all potential memory leaks and multiple deletions of pointers in a program. Our system automatically identifies the container implementation routines in an application. The user provides a short specification on the container structure and ownership constraints for these routines. The system then solves for the ownership constraints flow- and context-sensitively, and reports inconsistencies in ownership constraints as potential memory leaks and double deletions.We applied our tool to a suite of five large open-source and commercial C and C++ applications totaling one million lines of code. The tool successfully identified memory leaks in these programs and found double deletions of objects that could lead to program failures or security vulnerabilities.","inCitations":["139b0e82f8240b63ac49f19d0c0c1fdfecc466f0","5847f70d7e5ac58f94a9f7c0cc5e367036f9d2f4","21a685577013fed795c97fa85e53283622db811a","38ea96508e659e17389a2652ef89328044563888","d3bd6f8fcc3d2c2a5b13fce5a812fdc2439d7156","3e7801c6551c7e5ca10f894b39e1e401b760d398","f0207d2c5b977a422989ed2f61a76dfefc38dec6","3e70eb8a50c658ad5bca20bf69ed943f3af9f516","0498808f5b07d9355741b4c1d84a757e9ab136de","08594a76a9823172ba2978ffc98057761ef183be","af692a7cac8522d2f97f42d9dc86d45c0ed96af0","66fe3f7c67b402545cd7b5b42616f8091fda8b1b","1fe5cb846a0248ee5578376b0e31e32ba58c5789","6ebec69aefb07ec70ad7cc03e9c78a607ee0e2fc","ac278df758f22383ead69e2eed4f16b130de1a74","52f8642827802dfd881295d80ef8e9821a4e5f4f","b2e2c9fda43e9b8cfeeb67e4b65bb17ee214ee7b","17179e3554eb34a94c6aa3270e8b2cb9da9931b0","876f2f2d8fefa7ab5aa70f1a6c04012561d7ec52","a1537fb9c192dcfd397acf1363711e8eb35876e3","b3df9018cfadad1ae20d82d7071174dc01e6540a","6fa3b5c2438dd10845f8ed7a7a9b66292aac6468","449b3669cbf667ceebcdad0c4d04eed3d216faf4","a1d96bcf7a94f08717b15053c3888b290dda9570","b176bab2e6127b6b85cdf276cd426c86e54af788","2cc347d7ac76a26b072e25692122b729786fc4c1","092c8e7928f3eac0c2923272592ae962def7ad05"],"pdfUrls":["http://suif.stanford.edu/~dlheine/icse06-preprint.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134321","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p252.pdf","http://suif.stanford.edu/papers/icse06-preprint.pdf","https://suif.stanford.edu/papers/icse06-preprint.pdf"],"title":"Static detection of leaks in polymorphic containers","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134321","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134321","venue":"ICSE"}

While GUIs have become ubiquitous, testing of GUIs has remained until recently, a neglected research area. Existing GUI testing techniques are extremely resource intensive primarily because GUIs have very large input spaces. This research proposes to advance the state-of-the-art in GUI testing by empirically studying GUI faults, interactions between GUI events, why certain event interactions lead to faults, and use the results of these studies to develop cost-effective model-based GUI testing techniques. The novel feature of this research will be a reduced model of the GUI's event-interaction space. The model will be derived automatically from the GUI; it will be used to automatically generate specialized GUI test cases that are effective at detecting GUI faults. The model will be extended to develop new test oracles, new coverage criteria for GUIs, and new regression testing techniques. Moreover, this research will empirically evaluate the developed techniques.","inCitations":["583b061dba384b3e48616a9755b71ffebd9c5de0","774edab5e6919d634318edaf11b17048cef80e5a","f9aa696a0e65f36e5a04aa4170afce0070cae478","3274f2b1c44708098c29adfba85a572bd52e9ea7","41b27b765749523b6a93ad7c3e62f0fe65142f5f","e34058ef6a0efd7230929a92e066b76f9622bb2d","94bf91b029f7f9f58d977b8b741b5bda820ee4ee","5a080b52e9587b1d17a590ba6fcb8aac6d20e3e5","dfbe4bf616bc7208d6a1f18e2db7774a7f3d16a1","0153137d8335aa3863aaa17feb705134de35e0bc","d567e3ff110b86addfe2786544091a1cc171cbe3","13755d1e885e46344c436c8f18f8ccbad0194fd9","c22f115ed908406b9fd046171097ce7efee2c909","2cdfdc0a6c603398428caf8e510ad9b4599ff3a8","d1368b2c3e29c559996600a2b3ddb74ba3fd25ca","32982fe38492f86a89127634a435e5ccdf6ae4fe","dff8007e8440b15103bc943c66a19656e2205b89","a7cc282b06781c81291d9a2c747da4f1de06043f","34773ff0f5081922cef13653ac5908e1c448a5d4","0d58ced6ba4d981874e83ce5501719bf20bf7a61","29be720a8075e118e217f90ae85b0185d9bf639a","9932a23512599d0c0fcfc6f9a17b0c2821fb3627","2bb8e6171f20d663d79a3fca3eda2498f5c3162b","175795c13ebff9ef2b633172245afd318625a89e","2369034184582848f59dd40ad64f84ed66b81839","ba6ab76a51abe51ae1d15f734c4f5f6e1976b492","48011c68f344a520df5c4c9cf693bc8dc82ab589"],"pdfUrls":["https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4061/umi-umd-3801.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://www.cc.gatech.edu/morale/tools/isvis/2009/summaries/Developing_Cost_Effective_Model_Based_Techniqu.pdf","http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4061/umi-umd-3801.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://www.base-search.net/Record/f6ee28ca6f6992a1d728ae7202d0b713b554b636de672b73f12c59e3f7de26f0","http://www.cs.umd.edu/~qing/Dissertation.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p997.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134473"],"title":"Developing cost-effective model-based techniques for GUI testing","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134473","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134473","venue":"ICSE"}

Software architecture has emerged as a foundational concept for the successful development of large, complex systems. Signs that the field is maturing to become an engineering discipline include textbooks on the subject; the work in repeatable design, exemplified by architectural styles and patterns; robust methods for evaluating software architectures; international conferences devoted to it; and recognition of architecture as a professional practice. However, treatment of architecture to date has largely concentrated on its design, and to a lesser extent, its validation. But effectively documenting an architecture is as important as crafting it, because if the architecture is not understood (or worse, misunderstood) it cannot meet its goals as the unifying vision for system and software development. Three years ago, researchers at the Software Engineering Institute and the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science set out to answer the question: “How should you document an architecture so that others can successfully use it, maintain it, and build a system from it?” The result of that work is an approach we loosely call “views and beyond.” [1] Modern software architecture practice embraces the concept of architectural views. A view is a representation of a set of system elements and relations associated with them. Modern systems are more than complex enough to make it difficult to grasp them all at once. Instead, we restrict our attention at any one moment to one (or a small number) of the software system’s structures, which we represent as views. Some authors prescribe a fixed set of views with which to engineer and communicate an architecture. Rational’s Unified Process, for example, is based on Kruchten’s 4+1 view approach to software [4]. The Siemens Four Views model [3] is another example. A recent trend, however, is to recognize that architects should produce whatever views are useful for the system at hand. IEEE 1471 exemplifies this philosophy; it holds that an architecture description consists of a set of views, each of which conforms to a viewpoint, which in turn is a realization of the concerns of one or more stakeholders.

The language-action perspective of Winograd and Flores suggests that work results come horn the conversations people have at the office. Using the languageaction perspective, this paper creates a general framework for both systems analysis and its practice. Structured Analysis And Design Technique (SADT), a systems analysis methodology, is augmented using this hnework. This work took place on the CONTRACT (Commitment Negotiation and TRACking Tool) project. This paper includes the experiences of both users and systems analysts during the project, and emphasizes how to develop SADT descriptions with users to represent the richness and complexity of social interactions at WO*. The resulting software specification is also presented, including how it aided the work of the people who actually helped developed it. 1. An Introduction To The SADT Methodolo~ Struchued Analysis And Design Technique (SADT) is both a language and a process for systems analysis. Originally, it was created for describing systems and their operations (Ross 1977). The box-and-arrow language of SADT allows a systems analyst to draw diagrams of the activities, iuformatio~ and physical components of a system. For example, a box could represent an assembly activity and the arrows could identify parts, tools, and assembly instructions (Figure 1). The SADT process helps a systems analyst elicit requirements from users through interviews (Ross & Schoman 1977). The process also advocates iterative review of documented requirements by users (Figure 2), Together, the SADT language and iterative modeling process form a comprehensive methodology for descnbiug systems and specifying requirements. The SADT language and process are artifacts of a methodology rooted in general systems theory. This fact distinguishes SADT horn all other widely-used systems analysis techniques, which have their origins in software design. Thus, the SADT graphic language has representations for describing system qualities such as coordination, real-time interactions, and feedback. And so SADT practitioner me able t.o describe: computer-aided manufacturing (Ramirez 1989, Bailey & Thornhill 1990), real-time systems (Stockenberg 1989), banking (McDermott& Cot-trell 1989), decision support @lis 1989), process improvement (Preston 1989), technology planning (Thornbill 1989), sotiare engineering (Snodgmss 1989), and enteqxise integration (Pyryemybida 1989, Joyce& Nolan 1989). Coordination, interactions, and feedback are charactetitics of both automated systems like those mentioned above, and systems dominated by human interaction. For example, a variety of human interactions can be observed in the way people cooperate at work (e.g. negotiation, feedback). Focusing on cooperation in the workplace is an emerging discipline, currently called Computer-Supported Cooperative Worh or CSCW (Greif 1988). CSCW blends computer and social sciences. CSCW researchers have noted that human interaction plays a dominate role in the design of software (Bullen & Bemett 1990). This is in contrast to the view of technology being the sole design center for automated systems. These facts and trends led us to using SADT to describe a cooperative workplace. For example, imagine SADT being used to describe people co-authoring documents, coordinating tasks, providing feedback to each other, or any other collaborative situation in a typical workplace. Using SADT to model aspects of cooperative work seemed plausible, because SADT had suitable descriptive mechanisms in its graphic language. There was also precedent for aug‘emanti+ou ‘Fne!f Traditional Figure 1: SADT Graphics For Systems Analysis CH2982-7/91/OOOO/O094$Ol .0001991 IEEE 94 Recommended by: Elliot Chikofsky menting SADT to handle specific application domains (Brackett & Mc-Gowan 1977, Schoman 1979, Stockenberg 1989). This paper presents experiences in using SADT to describe a cooperative work-place and for eliciting requirements of cooperative group wo* situations. As it turned OUL the entire practice of systems analysis had to be re-examined and augmented before an SADT description of a cooperative workplace could be created. The next section of this paper explains why this occurred. 2. A Language-Action Framework For Systems Aalysis Systems analysts have traditionally sought to model the information flow of a workplace. This tradition has been profoundly shaped by software engineering practice, which fundamentally considers “information” as a “thing” that needs to be managed by computers. As systems analysts, we have all experienced workplaces and have, by tradition, modeled their processes as tasks and information flow. This kind of systems analysis works well, for example, when an anticipated computer system is being designed to merely ~place all or part of the paper flow in an organization. But we have also experienced the workplace as something more than just paper flow. The workplace appears to be very dynamic, where even the most “well-defined” processes have a “plastic” quality to them (found in Elm 1988). For example, in a manufacturing process for assembling computers, a process which people consider to be quite ‘%xed”, people are continually adjusting their tasks to suit their ever-changing work context (Marca, May 1989). Take, for instance, the situation where a person assembling a computer changes the order of the steps based on his or her knowledge of part availability on the floor for that day. In this case, that person is not strictly follow “the process”. So if people are not following a pre-specified process, what is going on at work? In the case of computer manufacturing, people spend a considerable amount of time talking to each other. On closer study, it was discovered that people converse to align their organizations and teams in order to accomplish the coordination needed to build a computer. For example, a “new product group” exists to expedite and manage the handover of hardware prototypes from engineering groups to manufacturing groups. The role of this group is primarily an orchesozztor of conversations between engineers and manufactwi.ng pemormel. Systems analysts practicing traditional methods can experience ext.xeme difficulty creating specifications of this kind of work from the perspective that the information is the thing to be studied. The reason is that a vital part of group membens’ work is their conversations: who they spoke with, what they said, and the business reasons for those discussions. Systems analysis can be simplified by first considering an alternate framework for understanding how people work cooperatively. The paradigm put forth by Winograd and Flores (see Win-ograd and Flores 1986) suggests studying the conversations people have at work. This paradigm provides a design center for developing a suitable framework for systems analysis. Using the Winograd and Fiores paradigm, one can approach system analysis with the following question: “HoIw should I practice systems analysis if I fundamentally shift my focus away horn ‘people just sharing information’ and consider instead ‘people having conversations ‘?” By corltinually asking this question during systems analysis, one cao see the results of group work as artifacts that stem from what people said they would do. For example, here are some building blocks of conversations that one can imagine happening in a large computer company for creating and improving products: 1) A declaration made by the president of a company (e.g., “We build workstations.”) creates a context for engineers to create new products (e.g., engineers then begin designing a workstation-class computer). 2) A commissive made by an engineer (e.g., “I willjlnish estimating the cost of the workstation redesign by next week.”) can impact the work done by other team members. 3) An assertion made by a marketing expert determines the business value of the engineering project (e.g., “We estimate people will buy 1000 workstationstweek over the next year. If, in four months, we can implement a re&sign which saves $100 per computer, we can spend up to $100,000 to make thut change and recover the cost over the product’s ll~e. “). Notice how these statements interrelate, build upon each other, and create a context in which coo~rative work can take place. (“Context” is a business situation and a corresponding rationale within which work takes place.) One could therefore say that speaking these statements in some sense creates the work.

However, polymorphism induces hidden forms of class dependencies, which may impact software quality. In this paper, we define and empirically investigate the quality impact of polymorphism on OO design. We define measures of two main aspects of polymorphic behaviors provided by the C++ language: polymorphism based on compile time linking decisions (overloading functions for example) and polymorphism based on run-time binding decisions (virtual functions for example). Then, we validate our measures by evaluating their impact on class fault-proneness, a software quality attribute. The results show that our measures are significant predictors of fault proneness as well as they constitute a good complement to the existing OO design measures.","inCitations":["1e0d63f93435ede49d7915066682736c35b49611","81146dd488874a9d5abf9b04ddfb12d009634f24","d054088730772ea0fc738e6a1092bcbd249b6701","676185fdb81f417844feb68b0ed3795a1efbba93","d89fa0fa9a6434830e6eb4e1616bcdee128c3a33","5a31fb376db7090696ac6760c7f9e1c6469558f0","f5c0109dffda55218e41a42536d6f4101760edf9","907a671bb896421834ba50d7ad801924bfea3735","da580f2a69038ffffd0df620a0e1d15c353336e3","8689724b561c03287ac61a4e4a8825659847ddda","055fa5b7ec8e073abd2bd3677aaa0c01d85e9968","04b78b4c4cd34ec75d750cbdc8bb47228def69fb","003a35dfd4c4960a67f8d5ca4f103c411becdaf6","4fc3b6a9465630049e965883055daa87e5c36cdf","088f9054d65420484d4d2e5576089e52268dc401","0e3d7e25dd2aefd58eacf3f85305c665cb2e567b","5cfd0ff17a2bea0643931d2689a2a3fee7138848","4257df2851c69e550069f9e84bd07202a9da3602","4c67a7122280e3190ff7fd548e7def6fce125e23","dd51227dec681d6d32c8d74393c365ebf023f13a","3bf92767b1ff6362527449b45273b7faa32e0dc4","7d272e092f015465149a97a106065418526526ad","d28a7f72f78a245e569d37ab6fc28141e559affb","da32c9c10a8225df1b7775e5be0f86acbcdc69cc","ef805d77c0811f5a5610021e26cb154a6b9f80f4","06c2a244487ccf50aeda239756367e1938cf55d9","8abb119c1d96818a4bcf5d3a0f469d0372c4c9d0","30c199e854d87dfb6a46e557289cebba58cbe9a3","7f541f38eadc654f8359583dd5b3b168f588c84b","b30ce8ecb13a513badadf561a44b45528e23886b","8929bdd4d9ca9bbd988e0974f457a1b118d0071a","4e85219e1a75af4d33662cd6173b7278747a64fd","123f6091f9af2325cd365082a50a22ec52f50836","82d94de08ff159ce8e13951bc72d02875f2d80f7","f5e62e5d5631e92969e3361b0ed6f9f94a09dfa6","78cc1575f6c0055e44dd4d019dd962bc29817b6f","731e84600af2a5476099eb7fc6481c84e99d0ef7","27581378c74ceb2622077df2becf9246369ace2c","0c473db5fcffdc3833311f40e0574ae16ed374fb","5c2eb170e3c53d9cb793ea4700261e8f6e19701e","6a4b295a78b73e64cacda3d09cdaaef268ec4cb0","7be4437af640f2f69322c35dd82e814901c42a7e","7da68ac56212b875749bacae5cee7647a6a5e7e0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.oocities.org/walcelio_melo/icse99.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302652"],"title":"Polymorphism Measures for Early Risk Prediction","doi":"10.1145/302405.302652","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302652","venue":"ICSE"}

It is highly challenging to detect plugin conflicts due to the exponential explosion of the combinations of plugins (i.e., configurations). In this paper, we address the challenge of executing a test case over many configurations. Leveraging the fact that many executions of a test are similar, our variability-aware execution runs common code once. Only when encountering values that are different depending on specific configurations will the execution split to run for each of them. To evaluate the scalability of variability-aware execution on a large real-world setting, we built a prototype PHP interpreter called Varex and ran it on the popular WordPress blogging Web application. The results show that while plugin interactions exist, there is a significant amount of sharing that allows variability-aware execution to scale to 2^50 configurations within seven minutes of running time. During our study, with Varex, we were able to detect two plugin conflicts: one was recently reported on WordPress forum and another one was not previously discovered.","inCitations":["7ca366931fa51e0d511d3b0c2529e712e7511302","8b638ef409b92642d653100c629fbc01b05268eb","6db0ad63a3a544252f05a6c42e6c9ece1e169f49","3231fb8cf64c8bc0b4602e43a692294d578da999","e14cc04d5608719c17a7a706993330ec7ef9cfd8","9d36545e04b3fce9bb00c4f2385a4354f266ce4f","4127e226b4aa16d4a1569a6775e27111ba60907f","306d6ca1d9893aadce6cd452b3746626e657632b","2150d6502ed0bcf1c3c7fef0cd08761014bfaf87","e2927845d634648dc3827f26eb9f7c0d2b744e36","02c258c1d1f611d09fb98e9b40aeb9d85cfa82b7","a69bd326939b200325299438a91a953d9ed939f3","7d22b0beb878bf93322353b3c0a3dbc9be7c16ea","9afffe04fe38d0c768b36d166500e8d964991896","cd736ac12a6477bcaacb5b3dc9a2cb07ea422c4b","fbc3e7ab99ba6946e8b5da180c5227f0b6920300","ca1940f74216bfef365b44ebe0854596844f1b40","3db39b71fbaef24e7289d83153ff61db5da70b5a","fa03fa1c7a3e7f311012687bc04fbd167aef9c32","4272256b7601cefff19f8a16e41dd42f58e53e67","2a0d09894b0b8d62e6879d441eb78f36d2909bcf","63671f1484cf13e1e38def7478a24f0de9440f3a","2488cb23b153a99c88650c70dcdb87dfa1581517","2b19928603046f330401981a67dac216bc07c1f8","997c4201b4360c52729a7c3073364ffc3b383a8d","fbc6bf2e2f914e6e8baf223e8e6c09535df9fb7e","123e5e7d1625d8e711dbde4645afd23515d75ce8","fe31b53e71d671628ff6af0f18475ea3e115f84c","146b3bf7a4a44effbf7ce4fa4026df6b5e4bd15d","47200497b988c76385c924d478106a636b00a51e","cd80bb3bdaecaa3dde9aab865d4011e9961db972","8c340c824d1e4e567dde09ac11648450bb18ba4a","005307f8c041c88fc4409aab76761e62e6cddb1e","2f5a9acbe7d44de84254b1637517f556cd32e13b","314df367f56c511726848523a23791e1714fd339","09d902d4c7ee312da08cfccd246c0f1985c37f1f","d3adef5bd8b29c5233600a57c9d678026c0b3c94","5f7542c50f5a84116c0c22a74be4e77b2c0d473a","23c3156bb0a0a3e6dbd1e46a145879be9cf2e38d","9552ee190e3414cc57d82136648a297bfae4541e","5f1baf6e40bcc4d3d9f86f40df9e479c68608a55","0dc128c8e1cf5352dbc2bb4155dea72275d9a5a8","32aba1e4c3b71f74a658475ce1d6d844a62557a5","3995f2439f9b21f7dfd97efcb4cd173602a0b5bc","1488ca0b7dde492b0841e162f39ff9d65067ff15","77fe22c7209de52527988cb6c61faac9ccfd4ce9","c34461bc73b1250d66b84a45afbcbde93063e9f4","54a2808d20c116ed3a3e43ef6839289ee1e0f6b3","b58787376cbdcc419ab3e28d972d2fa2fdbf7e3c","05883578bfca065d8b41e6858816a7eb5d698e57","1b0adcf3ad6532fc913fab4879fbbbaf5aaa0fb3","27db4a55426a87bfea8263ffc96039d9eccc677a","e305bc95c1e79091b4e632b5c1b2fe362dad805c","91787e91ea35c05889def52022c75ac65001f92f","e7fc701df39f8a325a1c61fac80a72fc3543d9cf","864d85c3ab1389b85d7556155d80373bec539754","c732e59de90ff5347b74585a409810712993af3f"],"pdfUrls":["http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~hungnv/Personal/papers/Varex.pdf","http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~hungnv/Personal/slides/Varex.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_varex.pdf","https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_varex.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568300"],"title":"Exploring variability-aware execution for testing plugin-based web applications","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568300","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568300","venue":"ICSE"}

Test cases are usually derived from requirements and documented in test case specifications. They provide a necessary basis for test implementation and execution. Therefore, test case specifications are a fundamental part of the automotive test process. The aim of this work is to gain insights into the creation and processing of test case specifications from a practitioner's point of view. In order to identify challenges concerning automotive test case specifications, we conducted an explorative case study based on 17 semi-structured interviews at a German OEM and three automotive suppliers. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively to identify the challenges. We summarized the challenge to a taxonomy consisting of nine main categories: (1) availability and (2) content-related problems with input artifacts, (3) knowledge-related problems, (4) test case related problems, (5) the test case specification content-related problems, (6) process-related problems, (7) communication-related problems, (8) quality-related problems, and (9) tool-related problems. In general, we noticed that the interviewees were aware of challenges in terms of test case specifications in the automotive domain. Nevertheless, some of the current solutions are not efficient and require a lot of manual work.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449465"],"title":"Challenges with automotive test case specifications","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195070","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195070","venue":"ICSE"}

A small development team of software developers and potential customers devised the unconventional process to meet a short deadline. The process produced an operational prototype or model of the entire software system that customers were able to use during the time it was being developed.\nThe first model of the Buster#8482; automated testing system was conceived, designed, and implemented ahead of schedule in less than six months, complete with many features and components. The Buster system provides a test-information subsystem with facilities for multi-project test sharing, per-project test storage and planning, and test downloading for lab use. A separate test execution facility is also included that features test-result logging, a results database, and per-session I/O recording. The customer, AT&T 3B4000 System Test, reports that system soak tests that had taken three weeks now can be completed in one week, using Buster.\nThe software modeling technique that was used to create the Buster test system is a new idea that can be used to produce reliable low-cost software in many applications. Unlike more conventional software engineering approaches, including rapid prototyping, the model can be used by customers as it is slowly evolved into a finished product. The model is used to embody and test designs and identify missing requirements before making large investments in production level code and documentation. In addition, software modeling makes it possible to develop comprehensive system test suites long before production level software is available. The process is composed of three major components: brainstorming and team building with customers, high-level language engineering, and automated software testing.","inCitations":["4a29836eeaf56e901f8436bf68dd45359e176a69"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=55844"],"title":"Modeling Software Tools with Icon","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

In data-$ow testing the paths selected for exercising are variants of “defluse” (DU) paths for program variables. Tool support for data-fiow testing takes the form of static program analysis (to determine possible data-flow paths) followed by run-time instrumentation (to record paths actually executed during test). The output from a test analyzer is a list of untested, possible D U associations. We have a novel approach to constructing testing-support tools, in which it is easy to experiment with new analysis methods. We describe the implementation of a DUpath analyzer as an example of this approach. Using a prototype tool, we report on experiments and issues raised by an analyzer that treats arrays differently than existing tools: each array element is considered to be a distinct data-jiow object. 1. Support for Data-flow Testing The first testing tools made use of run-time instrumentation to record test coverage. The methods they supported (statement-coverage testing and branchcoverage testing) required no further analysis, since the program structures to be covered are explicit in a program listing. However, path testing requires calculation of potential paths, and for data-flow testing those paths are further restricted. Potential-path calculations are static, but without them the dynamic information on test execution cannot be reported by exception. Exception reporting is necessary because the tester is interested in what has not been covered, and T Work supported by NSF grants CCR-8822869 and CCR-91 10111. A preliminary version of this paper was presented as an abstract at ICSE 14. ultimately in the “success” message: “Coverage complete.” A large list of paths that have been covered is not useful. 1.1. Static Analysis Calculation of worst-case possible program paths is a well studied problem, which arose, like much of the background for data-flow testing, in compiler optimization research [Allen]. Many compilers include the necessary algorithms, which construct the flow graph of the program being compiled, then traverse the graph to find paths. Optimization techniques also compute data-flow information, by iterative y annotating the nodes with information about variable usage as the graph is traversed [Kildall]. The most important data-flow idea is the “clef/use” (or DU) path. A DU path for program variable V is intuitively one that begins with v acquiring a value (perhaps by an assignment), follows the program control flow, and ends with a use of v. Along the way V may not acquire another value, although there may be intermediate uses of V. The technical definitions are surprisingly difficult to get right we mostly follow the careful work of [Rapps] when precise definitions are requiredl’~. 1.2. Run-time Instrumentation Recording the paths actually traversed during program testing is also an old problem that has been solved in many ways, from preprocessing into a “selfinstrumented” program source [Stuki] to the use of special hardware coprocessor that monitor the Tf Because we ,are not concerned with the inclusion hiemrchy that motivated a peculiar definition of “p-use” IXappsl in a conditional expression that influences control flow, we instead take such a use to occur only at the expression, not along the tsvo subsequent branches. 118 0270-5257/93 $03.00 @ 1993 IEEE memory bus to record execution flow unintrusively. The result of testing an instrumented program is a collection of paths executed during the test. By comparing this list with the static list of possible paths, coverage can be reported by exception. The “feasible-path” problem enters here, because if a path is possible in the uninterpreted flow graph, but impossible in actuaJity because of some conflict between the particular conditionals used, then it will be on the static list, but must remain forever unexecuted. Like most unsolvable problems that arise in testing, this difficulty is left for the human tester to resolve. It is often pointed out that it is a salutary exercise to establish by hand that a path is infeasible. Section 3.6 describes how to do better in a data-flow test analyzer. 1.3. A Novel Tool-building Technique Prototype tools are essential for experimenting with testing techniques that require extensive bookkeeping. These tools need to change frequentl y as techniques are refined. It is common practice to implement research prototypes in a conventional programming language like Pascal (ASSET [Weyuker], STAD [Laski]) or in C [Ostrand]. No matter how “quick and dirty” the implementation is, the prototype takes months to write, and is as hard to modify as any medium-sized program. We build prototype tools using three established computing technologies: (1) Selj-instrumented programs. The program is outfitted with monitoring statements in its own language, interspersed with the original program statements in such away that when the program executes, the added statements collect relevant information. This technique has been in use for at least 15 years [Stucki]. (2) Table-driven parser generators. Compiler compilers are widely available that construct a parser for a programming language from the language grammar. (The UNIX system compiler compiler we use is a combination of the tools called lex [Lesk] and yacc [Johnson].) Arbitrary actions can be performed using context-sensitive syntax-directed translation as the constructed parser identifies the input source program. In a compiler, these actions build a symbol table and perform context checking; in self-instrumenting a program, they echo the source, add the instrumentation statements, and record information for static analysis. (3) A logic-programming language. Languages like Prolog have several important advantages in creating prototype analyzers. Prolog can express facts about programs and executions in a database fashion, and Prolog can query those facts interactively. The declarative Prolog programming style lends itself to describing software analysis. It has been used in this way for a static FORTRAN analyzer [Harrison]. We have combined these technologies to achieve very rapid generation of program-analysis tools, which are easy to change. The time from conception to running prototype is an order of magnitude less than for conventional development in a high-level language. Changes in the analysis algorithms are even easier to implement.","inCitations":["ca0d9342283f521f57cbfa9eeaa147f2a1c84d4a","db4e7d4955c7385eee813f1bac774314a5c6ed26","0371b4ff2fdfd7e3c343f9744527a28d7e44485a","341fc6dbc51b4c9356da04076f644f29fea0775f","38c845a4baa2eb52eaa345853ca261a16b15d257","2e075ce16e8ae513520158b97ddb677824f580c8","bcf48e3cd9fb60597339779acb7c0943522a14f9","9e0c837ea97037e48219d22cd40eaccdc5e76c15","01ee8c846e27d3d9e3b19bf6046bf220e55e5187","c8a51408715d8367df975a1fccd4143c89b467ae","bcca469571a0710c7c42ce884cf57fd4099183df","503f83289a8cd13ffffd5bb7d4ffd17f2994514a","47f6bd72c9df94652356f10a8e252f532f083137"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257572.257600"],"title":"Exploring Dataflow Testing of Arrays","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Crowdsourcing has been applied quite successfully in various contexts from basic tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk to solving complex industry problems, e.g. InnoCentive. Companies are increasingly using crowdsourcing to accomplish specific software development tasks. However, very little research exists on this specific topic. This paper presents an in-depth industry case study of crowdsourcing software development at a multinational corporation. Our case study highlights a number of challenges that arise when crowdsourcing software development. For example, the crowdsourcing development process is essentially a waterfall model and this must eventually be integrated with the agile approach used by the company. Crowdsourcing works better for specific software development tasks that are less complex and stand-alone without interdependencies. The development cost was much greater than originally expected, overhead in terms of company effort to prepare specifications and answer crowdsourcing community queries was much greater, and the time-scale to complete contests, review submissions and resolve quality issues was significant. Finally, quality issues were pushed later in the lifecycle given the lengthy process necessary to identify and resolve quality issues. Given the emphasis in software engineering on identifying bugs as early as possible, this is quite problematic.","inCitations":["f903cd00a3a9b761c5e9824d114edac55d87a7d6","d26edf8bec5fdcda900bd19680d9be0df465ee56","00895c8872c91ee8a57817e9f63ee6de2b3b2c98","b9f63e90c3363665ec4571bff72326a44aafac4c","047e2c41128f3cbd9d7f45271943064eb9f11178","ecb248a250f1ceea29041288fb4985dcb943821a","94e3fdaf7939f6c48c83fdffb6de1d1ba08dd158","30e41e8fda4ba3a9950d67e481d4d41ac1e324e7","c4563e68dd8802c2aa27b18a7f71ced4dbc17fde","460e1e962f5df0f8b28ab29547d74799fbb97280","50a62bd25e66b428d57e1f0a794920fb68bed1e4","e1dfa8581aa6350555856ac958f639ba15099b5d","584e1277b4df557749e7547dc73a2b6a56707dfa","0d65335c7d7831a1a21d3352d0fa05026a8d12fc","756e2bb25f9c0d3a5971cd7a9f697b5b0522095e","3fc19075569865aa84c9078faf30001b266f37f1","826bb9326410dfcbbcc74aac9b6e3996406956c8","9ab4763cb68cbcbabdc0bcb3e1d7ec634fdc2f88","485190ad19253600c3b7f3cf2a28fd19f5793340","6d85d3995b87312cd73a279c130d705ad309cd34","66f7182cac2cbf3c46a9acd3b1da78ec07751124","c6af3ec1856dcde87f927d64604f8c179e799308","216932333a3cee5456ca50b29b06edbad1d0409f","013f6d063c1157d5020bb147db4f13db421f233b","c9f5c0624f9427c1f8617ad957123f1709610d48","317efc348a99759e0f6fdd6b1e0ab944bc770b9c","176893017b96d14f936f7fca3c807efc5ce13af6","0fd6c39a001d4249c5cb9bd0d01b5c0f3a997df2","96f31328914b36129cf22b34ea193244f5d60683","6dd668bbd19d94b7d9af1ed09f4a8b56aec48d3c","787ce8e0973fd21051260385bb27d74f6f53c7f9","77cf7137c884b14c20b7b9c95d513c28e550ec75","d3c7378a568b81c45759698a0548080dbd7c656b","5ca134e0f56a383ba62d8ce333c791d564f54ab2","1076820ea04a7e07b5db13cb11bfe04d1ee20672","7e365536e8e6eef161046d355e11cabf0ea139bf","2b88ab20a1d4d0719e256bc2fd4e9d780ef57932","d675d795a8911dfc1ff5cf8eff24b18e7b2364e4","9b482ce6dda2bf7d2255c281b6a4390b1291c59a","44f48fb9f6d1dc09247672a99e160096c5bd1e9f","35fbe22bf669016278db527275362ad01be0b766","db85bf90e7e42afcf5f9fea3bb0f1043c3255dba","fcc63e705e6b70e21a477668646ea21b10594020","fc7361ccbb107cb9d859d6d57e6cdbc4ebe05930","1fceb55922e2dab0bb6605f4516783e67b366635","a27d8762658333da5d7c300314ea976ae6a37ea7","af5feee929317e136483202d127797540da195bc","316c82148879593ec379b169cc6c8a3ea79c6043","6f06f321dc55d2270b8e15be3f1972c91a76a726","487bb3f10a2efbef0ecb03af4a9533106a0a67fc","51b502b9ce774a615474ed8629e74d0dfaa33ee3","307677f9d27f9f58e2aafc37c6023a7a7158788e","09c19f79ff1bf85583bb3b53aa2bd65378ad063f","0a1b0fa164f8552f49efd2670654acae014bcd45","1cb542e0f3375864614ef34c7d19ed4868a4549a","fc43d9f831df0f49dd29ead9b51899223d6a5081","f81d72bdb48f7e946e984b9fea9e8d3041a222ba","4a15574f2a964714344781315dd9f05c52f507bb","608195c8849a87fd445a3d7edcd7d8c7521e31a0","e36d5f2ee75c52d16181b455aeaad35f5dfa605e","bcaacac925a1c37d55a46f21403c770e16d62a1b","5e70b72555fdbd92ead468f0f76acaa285c2dc6b","c141268d514053358a13badddf4a331a9c81783a","0ae72802fc836335036ec444ca89a35f6a21d8eb","1ec162d6eb8b533af0723f913b84fabaa39dde01","c633c5303ba8719981a599393ebe9e25ec976ffa","529d7ec408c83e51e715c20c40146dd08dbccfaf","58d6b2543424a1884fda61a49af7553d396b3208"],"pdfUrls":["http://staff.lero.ie/stol/files/2014/06/p187-stol1.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Klaas-Jan_Stol2/publication/259740478_Two's_Company_Three's_a_Crowd_A_Case_Study_of_Crowdsourcing_Software_Development/links/0c96052ff5f0ad4681000000.pdf","https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/3982/fitzgerald_2014_company.pdf?sequence=2","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568249","http://www.brian-fitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/stol_fitzgerald_icse2014_crowdsourcing_preprint.pdf"],"title":"Two's company, three's a crowd: a case study of crowdsourcing software development","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568249","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568249","venue":"ICSE"}

This, in turn, upper bounds the overall economic benefits that can be accrued from product line based development. Inherently, product line scoping is difficult because of the complexity of the factors that must be taken into account. Many are not known a priori. Traditional scoping approaches (from domain engineering) have focused on the notion of application domains. However, domains proved difficult to optimally scope and engineer from an enterprise standpoint because a domain captures extraneous elements that are of no interest to an enterprise which must focus on particular products, whether existing, under development, or anticipated. Hence, the domain view provides a flawed economic basis for making a scoping decision. We introduce in this paper PULSE-Eco, a technique especially developed to address the aforementioned issues. Its main characteristics are: a complete product-centric orientation done via product maps, the separation of concerns achieved through the definition and operationalization of strategical business objectives, and last, diverse types of analyses performed upon product maps allowing scoping decisions based on these objectives. We illustrate the technique with a running example.","inCitations":["ef864da39c0dc45269718e44f05de61650404667","c0c48fb92c92f8045b651bcffea19297dc1a8271","bb5d8bf9a71aaabe4f0783447a0419cce23b3f19","7c24633e686ef265a362c6e0dd469bbdaf4abdb2","d7658334c6f2f285c0b91638c7ad96b8b41b48e8","1b065008908031157001d9b72be628860dafe8f4","404fb1029295c3e19a0753b745819e1508f344a5","444b1f6c8089162acbc3202a9c20b06434d65624","d1fa8cf4ab0feaa5e278accd62eddcde6b34c843","ff07bd2f822564ee6ee6f8c23b0efe886ee9a865","6aa2db41ac587c6a8df11df5e77b331b108c6f94","1ccbe2d1f4fe977bc79be04c2a668b1bbf06f89f","09802108baa28a7fe191fd32ad34846920673028","01802c09e716014b1ba8d2c0a233deeb269f8694","a1d5d930846c51b83455b1cbc814ab978cfbeae0","effdce50228c3836da1946dc5b5462b01c4d12a5","44934ed461ef2ea48a59d26ea0aa431c03c371d5","7bf62ccdf90682b89590ec4f1ad9218294b1dd5c","3586f9888dcec469fe31fb55cfca9e468e035c5f","cd24d3515438166456673e495203fc7b38d3bca7","5bbc30d3d488fc33a853aab00903d07d2ecf6523","7f43cd40538eb638bd7cb6c5ca196823e5a896f4","842e89becf848e184d7d56d2af8b50e9fe4ccdba","72b636236024af9a242769312d0a27795427589b","6b39d43577418e6283d583cc1af9e982980c539d","ab158d44e3925077cf8dc1f96529ab52f236ca0a","cfe3506b3cb207642fd14792f6705128b88436ff","fc0ccf993661ff7f04c57e8cda799e9937c3bc67","de204398aefd8458504d97f518d860e9b99fd76c","3b57140697df8819fd653be69862979ebddd16d2","4c2100419a44baf666e97d2931d58d97869b5353","2e506c26c220fe9f6d9047dc76892de563fb9eaf","035ca6300bbcf0f2930c47db9ca142916f989ce9","ad9af5fced52931f3f27f4534ebd3f7cd181e2bc","2559fbb398a8208576a165dfe1e19d2bc7e68dcc","7527116d1372fa0ad40fcff772ae276e58133e03","95ff6432070ff772b611d1ecc25c2b5b568eaf71","e2833831cb6df96849d5a1841f827c02ecebbed7","13e31abc3bbbf13af8a71157b4761839d7587bab","2d41e2d9d1ad2463fe2baf9d1a7fd8ddbd994687","43ef8552b8ef0fbc49e68dc56636cc7701b56485","799169e956f803c4f26c923107abcc9453835bff","fc54c61e3bd6a0815a0254bf984ee6ccef05725f","9e3bb1b2f14f1ffee9f415104e0f52e8ff85e71d","da0f22082e11fa32f70920a11a403812a891abba","30d91ead5fa5a36482614eaf31bb9793a69ab539","d05c4a914742504f5973316eefa48977d2f93398","cced42aaae9483eef07caf4dddd602861f793314","054591d5dbf570c2d136b61fe2f37b18f9a5bcc6","42bcc94fbe0055fb9708a3bbd0f1512c71e9a3cd","a3c265c0b6077705512dce7338966daec7ee2eea","0a37a21d8a6ad4ea532a6f7499a256a4085d62e6","4a5db9db8c22bab5b4ae2f804f7fcf1bfcadb1bb","c7efc7d8f4bd2a7e1cf66c21ae5a38307e284d3e","78057db749e59aff2a7dc348bc351d59a4997df3","520c7832e1ec29cbd090c3f05aa6eff7da5718c3","d467c0d0be993cb380b2a4f3dbb37691950b8fa0","ef7cdd0ae56de181715e1a205cafbe8c9d51c503","e37c2e56eb9d0d868db57538028d18ab930d93b6","55d062c8c59d34c4a4bbd080e127d40aa3de5e63","c760a2093ad29b830dd1598a12d8f18b3e8d90f0","121086b35fef938defcbadf08a4ddd55679f9624","350e8194a10688c3c320eb1082f100065486e937","7587adf2fa3f7862bd1aca711a2afa8ca9a7065c","a4fead7b148c55a856efc29fabe9890997262c74","02b7ed56a81f683ee90c8550730aec0ee30621d5","3478c0e633b4f9cec048e7cd880c9d63063f3173","1151dfc99a4274a48a6572a0ffbac4bd7b1cfe6f","08e7a641d60a3bd3c72d481ed95b83cb1a60f74e","33670f402d5aea4175f97ac4f8070bbb6da58ce2","1c0035f4a831db04c0e45eae0258aadd4be1efbd","de712fb8ccd0c0a7c1685854a8d0123c4f4a2109"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302409","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Klaus_Schmid/publication/3846269_A_systematic_approach_to_derive_the_scope_of_software_product_lines/links/0fcfd51388590cbb1e000000.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Klaus_Schmid/publication/3846269_Systematic_approach_to_derive_the_scope_of_software_product_line/links/0fcfd51388590cbb1e000000.pdf"],"title":"A Systematic Approach to Derive the Scope of Software Product Lines","doi":"10.1145/302405.302409","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302409","venue":"ICSE"}

There are still few examples of its successful application on a large scale, partly because of the complexity of initiating a product-line engineering project and the many factors that must be addressed for such a project to be successful.This tutorial draws on experiences in introducing and sustaining product-line engineering in Lucent Technologies and in Avaya. The objective is to convey to participants the obstacles involved in transitioning to product line engineering and how to overcome such obstacles, particularly in large software development organizations. Participants will learn both technical and organizational aspects of the problem. Participants will leave the tutorial with many ideas on how to introduce product line engineering into an organization in a systematic way.","inCitations":["92952908d95b860e05e7a743b76716f9166d3f7b","fe7ccecd693f6949c3a482ee6d1c59b7265c1d91","6062ba88f04fc57f49e3223e742f9d6ead1f9300","eb6b346e68d50b26c6ab428da65bd1a962d181e6","16f69938f36978f738979c6c74d0bccfbeb7d820","6bd7804fd11645756964ce63a4748327dbe1af97","5b6f70315640b1a649527a293c5cf51bb3e21afe"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-28630-1_24","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776934"],"title":"Industrial-Strength Software Product-Line Engineering","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-28630-1_24","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-28630-1_24","venue":"ICSE"}

Program slicing is one of promising techniques for identifying portions of interest. There are many research results on the program slicing method. A static slice, which is a collection of program statements possibly a ecting a particular variable's value, limits the scope, but the resulting collections are often still large. A dynamic slice, which is a collection of executed program statements a ecting a particular variable's value, generally reduces the scope considerably, but its computation is expensive since the execution trace of the program must be recorded. In this paper, we propose a new slicing technique named call-mark slicing that combines static analysis of a program's structure with lightweight dynamic analysis. The data dependences and control dependences among the program statements are statically analyzed beforehand, and procedure/function invocations (calls) are recorded (marked) during execution. From this information, the dynamic dependences of the variables are explored. This call-mark slicing mechanism has been implemented, and the e ectiveness of the method has been investigated.","inCitations":["51211c46f6587f74ef805c4d8e5b908e2ccfa0a0","066a858a7714567ec02ea1c569c57851b76997b1","468bff8de97b7380ff497eea8eec3c9621218a40","467f3695d3b1c649c4954d3ffb203f8030e25b0e","f2a9970ee20190dde62e150e919f25f070406124","46fd72b7867d67d5bec3dfaaabce29e25d6f60ea","705d9d72015edb7d9aec9ff5a0742fdf45fbe6d8","f0a80b0a6ce0bf5caf63fa9b1875451a2fe0c16c","5704aba27fd5fdaab8ddf5d7639b4e3209fa04d6","44dda77aa68120e4f87a0638081c9dfe23687f8e","bc60304f0fd0d860bb71d7c7d56c5d6e82921d17","1e918581a06bad6b219c233a862e4c99e03aaab5","96a3b86c32a8f350404becf48a0a7ee71c58ec28","99358a9148069f04e2bb6522263ae49096db2819","090203127dc92ba26f7e6df39e0a12aa238e7a58","b9360d03b64ea79837311f6997d96876f3fad91a","00b5e99f17f457c2943b887707bba92d0c0c77c8","33d94e89e33351e0bdbebde592e83a5b2e1d9d2b","1cecaa83dba2d09934f0b6d16bc514471fa4e12b","6355c456a3471a59c28f00ff1d14f9a4f58c52bc","fcc24aa8c859fdd7402cc07655cd3aa227400f96","ea2c2d07b0104574a1785b7269d7743f1fb724e9","9c1dbfb65418a648a722f6254422f42f945b5c8a","1a7e3008f325a079107470a8372bb0e6497b2ad0","65e31d1dd633357e3ac1ce9dba788fa0b46ff6f7","2bba335bbad5dceb4d54a71d840b54d2dd1df51b","57b2d6d17051aaa1f523d112c44bc2c2930996e8","1f5ecfc58f8d6bd9bb4cf451576ad191f48a0f38","8e17de5dd2b940cbdb958977f25a92b7ac276faf","bfc9e18abdc235a3eb0b865790c2d34f339d60b0","802387217cce9f147b9d73edfeeef43174cb2c59"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302674","http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/lab-db/betuzuri/archive/274/274.pdf","http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~lab-db/betuzuri/archive/274/274.pdf"],"title":"Call-Mark Slicing: An Efficient and Economical Way of Reducing Slice","doi":"10.1145/302405.302674","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302674","venue":"ICSE"}

Intuition is often used to handle uncertainty in design parameters. Since uncertainty seems to be intrinsic to most design problems it follows that designers will continue to rely on intuition or “sound engineering judgement”. This paper attempts to use Bayesian Decision Theory to explore the possibility of setting up a structure and theory for making design decisions in the computer system design environment while explicitly taking the intuitive nature of many design decisions into account. We shall focus attention on a particular problem in distributed data base design in which the designer must use his intuition to estimate the load on the system which he is designing. Similar Bayesian approaches could be used in other design problems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807688"],"title":"Bayesian Models of Design Based on Intuition","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

We have developed a component-rank computation system, and applied it to various Java programs. The result is promising such that non-specific and generic components are ranked high. Using the Component Rank system as a core part, we are currently developing Software Product Archiving, analyzing, and Retrieving System named SPARS.","inCitations":["db1489d7e16f7f57f68e918c38ed068bda5fad16","a222ca20a235c087efeab06917c5cef004d0678a","6b3436d1626970915f690294970b61aa214ba136","5d470cdac0dbdc28e1a6f16ffd0a0d9f435c476e","8d06847ef1edd154cc2c008abed7d3f14595ae2a","de42149bef0f519aa129929fda020fdf2eb3869c","53b11821b366364b4e408998da252e268f824cb9","1c2d95c861352e91591879bca7338ff9aaeb12c9","7e50195838ee9aee2a3a0675396077d1f73c44f6","79c3ad6a4bd46055de9207450dc62b6e6e0662ac","d8cbee0b275a66dd4db1382364ab097ea978fc15","b5830e0a415d37416f0f1bb5999b91e5ac7802c5","58e54d8bac888968c95bab6100f20e8a307ca296","315e836d55d5ed1c661d046ef45b23bce96b4909","afed70375ba41bb07eafc5a1f2cae54720876929","ef15db69e7d93b9030ba736f0066ad7156182825","a582637fa7d7823d14c7c56e25d1b933691b7536","713de05bc807ca6471fb203abfc6d648c914c382","1e5720ef753485abab20eda15b72d795909976f7","1933b8e459f2032aef6932c441e374c26621a4c5","5a2854010b6fde10bf6cd50c054803f80a8ca534","129a61b59e202a734a3776e97305baeb37c9cd0f","44079037e8111526cbc3e8a098317498f4e2af8c","9e23f8c5c3c89e71158387cadaf0f8002e82f4b8","8cf3523b384cc91593c38e418e71147163b2deba","ba3bca98a4f9d96654aecfa749636ea26c08bfef","28deeb4fca936f88cdb81e7f0dd18f3567276dce","e18a92c11a5348e05c7b82821729a3001b31fdf4","0476be0d8364af69acd3fa19ada78b0a8f7cbf95","1c83ce7ccff476ce17b51e5cc52ed542b628d622","4311aa9a2fce08873dbc11bca71e8d19ac98e536","1004b13568bb5209b546067bff453b308dfee26e","c6460aafccd0c7cee3f271e998ecda4724eab9cf","7fb93cea542b1ff3ba84760d8f52a9f9d305ae15","abbbbd5e200b3a156a46104fbda48056d0335469","23f83ebb8a95a8f92ea9c9e3d408aafc2e8d88c2","b9448ecf412c60ef70876d3fe83f88151d4b860b","99ef7a54d50ff876c04d88df9b02871c099db16b","57f53cd222e72f2e84aae0c5d4b78112db8cf62a","013fa6eb3ac8606d5f801c5fb8d7d9ea35a673e2","168a7cfed6c7a07a130d5260e1838dd2a9bb66db","739d86f0513b03df0a0d4e940b0dc62031b5dbae","ce9f7e3839d2c574f80ebfc2eb48c7ca4101234a","ce2f75deee86ab9d6565ab4cf075a4f5cd2c09fa","46a1c7d1fbe9cb8260f1e6987dc08e13337ae73d","7cea381e31c985457a458e91723f33cb26f4c844","abc4026f27501ab9a9d9845cfc02ac4fecb12724","9d4b4e73ed7ee6efc9ecc51df414e1e8d27aba92","6c52a78c6627af5e1af72546a70bf858185cc91c","37d0fac9bdfe735db0da044fcd90932435db7eea","71d1fc9886930be72629dd5db64ebe3d91893d22","b2a1a100367a802fba0793196516a5047871f622","6081ceb60d07fa0a2f0037ece6e540228e4edf73","ca63878df4f8e56f417aa8cce151da68bbe4c805","0ac23bb2db65272abbe64fde3c14c3c942557ffe","47e2d7fb1a870f3197dbdc674228c637a9ac5d22","80773efd1f515de200c0055675309581208c6d23","331580693b03847f003073d25871e8f99e320644","2f1608ca4578bfd01df707a626d09216614c1af7","8eae8ea948ecbe09bfd0b2d63a1b81a6670e65cf","a9ca35e5149336462486ff2ead787cb9dd579175","65a139d7f368bafdb043fb4ddc0c499b611361fd","d2d4baa9741b778d78374f5016e0596849044dc6","db09a3c985ece746646fd7374bda0268aa9643a1","e93489e48fb070a36a6ebdae0a3879fe1ffad02f","1733d50afa19500b84a5108cd7602ec15451ff9f","9fca81ac03ceb88596ac5e8f9cd8bdf7fb319c29","a144d8910bfc67d24cde5c9625e49e40c18d9afd","09c1e7175cbb631249621f603e8f5e6e3e06fc46","1faabd21b3772f062e937aa44e7826f09257791f","48f1749d6a93d7b05c01a7caad75d8af521d39ba","42b92153c4f1136d63c60d236255c94ca9c61812","0e704cc03ebb25a3253e5150a82e465dcc9a2662","07d801a87ea39cd38fe5d31b14835603fa0b6532","3136abfdff4b5bc1224bcf7f4c0434d9fa4c5991","94b25bf661223850b443796692a57af83aee4535","422a9be83abb620a60bb586471f5b08e6a35ac86","be857aa23eb1878b7ba6aa9ff64676d4002ef609","18a098b27a5b8ecbf4d29e4ff719f206b751405c","0950b4ee174eeceba43b49e085f21b98d417ada0"],"pdfUrls":["http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/lab-db/betuzuri/archive/391/391.pdf","http://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~lab-db/betuzuri/archive/391/391.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776819","http://iip-lab.ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/~lab-db/betuzuri/archive/391/391.pdf"],"title":"Component Rank: Relative Significance Rank for Software Component Search","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

One of the key nefds in the design of these systems is to get guidance towards the definition of a system truly analyzable against titding requirements; specialised methods and tools are most needed to accommodate this particular demand. This papkr reports on the use of a novel design method especially tailored towards the construction of hard real-time systems.","inCitations":["b5fb253ac4e8ef85a765fede9e30e6f4c967c28b"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257791"],"title":"Experience with the Development of Hard Real-Time Embedded Ada Software","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

During specification design, designers negotiate amongst themselves and with a project leader. Throughout the specification of a system, people communicate needs and constraints in ways which benefit the project or themselves. The study of such behavior has been valuable to disciplines such as contract negotiation and office management. However, software engineering has yet to address negotiation behavior. Here we show how negotiation applies to specification. We present automated means to promote integrative behavior during specification. We conclude that formal models of users’ desires and resolution methods are necessary for integrative reasoning. Our research is focused on modeling and automating the software specification process. We have found this requires expanding the concerns of software analysts to include heretofore ignored issues. Multi-agent specification design is one such issue. This paper reports on our work concerned with mu1 tiagen t specification design. We describe how various agents, often with conflicting goals, can resolve their differences, integrate their results, and produce a unified specification. Such bargaining behavior is both ubiquitous in complex specification and unrepresented by current methods. The following example will help illustrate this. Consider the following transcript of an initial dialogue between a systems analyst ( A ) , a manager (M) , and a user (U) of a university admissions system. 79:u","inCitations":["c87be4add99f5d3745e3fd48ebeb7ff9ba676c2c","74b274a318f3524c419fdc5c720d548220072bab","843a0a8d9019ad0077d389a9753960bc82e15587","4228ddc3ae19dfff2e05e7d12db6f5ea0bd6968e","f1cd2a8c54ed07cd59b58e787c4140b86474c81b","9909549b91ebbedc3e845e5ebceac91de4ba681b","38f4a62c3577ddefb42b573e625bc9efd6ad7c7d","c4aa684e3403bee19c2d5e51bb2b07c82a546c47","ecd7ca3276b8f4260b6e191e15d9178f604ecca6","678b02fe995e7b9c32a82c2afea4741deb40e6ea","2718cc211c6ae63876fe552aadf96de13735eff8","570018a30d62bfad00c323e9ccbefe953f96e025","7edc523e22b9ed3c6ffd56a0cd99373a23fc4476","841ef62132096212ade66b17d080030a8ca978c7","84f34e13518f4f2a63550302ba9f61460984f55a","ce0987e5beb0f3f2d7fe1b3d676f99e453c417ab","aca54a9e8b575ce48567d2c3efc8c87565e74544","467df4858d8fe73b06d69cb1de0902272a5ea895","41c83b7084b613e22523010547b6317344f57111","7ca508b0c8820e62c59642d64793fdd322cf987f","40aa473439de703954dd58651c9be77361d30aad","061a67c019d6fc9c4cf39ce30e868f1d99e33b82","518beedc882299b5458871b5cac831dce82d598b","89af6821c6b8ef566c7ef68b82c0122f6566c620","79d2d9a39534bdb1cfa6e3e0f6223f864cb22df0","1f5b5c4b8abeb6cb29e0289491fa56878c20b3aa","9d6fa332746577e0062a802c89c4d6e999d349af","e3f8597b2bdff7e325c974c563fac489674a0f1c","0ee2fe4ff9f7c772c3e7ffc006bf387f2d31082d","8dd69f4f2dc13e126384353bdaccffb1eb1b15a1","267d03f3dcea0006a837da714db279bdd233f1b8","84c55f8e8e4dc206ff9b46ec769e2c0e9fed6db7","5a30fd3718835c500d1833492d6cd833c959d155","ddc06261209b28239bdb527211f4bfb26fcc75a3","d8081de22fa8a97d98e9f80fe84b4b77c0c3fbf9","4ec2fd2740200d16c42bf9f34b77320711cadc43","dc961011f037b1889aaaea3959d6c5add8b4c372","c460f2341676a12233bc3e23da446d7e85c9bd39","c50f1deb7749487337805e5c3c12da949dfb2da8","f8e47580b6a9a018bcab9e36e1e2d674dd2e3514","32725497dcbdb202b433e10ea79db0ae0dbc9638","af9bdac959c4153d73c63450fc3c1e2143363d5a","26cdadddf1e56005b87ca467e31a0cb6b643700b","aa5bc888de8fc0263fb3f5aca58c6c090789a767","e04911a339f5f38be1e280fbe42e2fcff57cb2a9","17c57724e6f3e7a4156cc2c5268b81d4be4c0082"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/1990/2026/00/00063633.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=100335"],"title":"Negotiation Behavior During Requirements Specification","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The advantage of this formalization is that it distinguishes precisely those aspects of an environment that are useful in comparing and contrasting software development environments. We introduce four classes of models by means of a sociological metaphor that emphasizes scale: the individual, the family, the city and the state models. The utility of this taxonomy is that it delineates the important classes of interaction among software developers and exposes the ways in which current software development environments inadequately support the development of large systems.\nEnvironments reflecting the individual and family models are the current state of the art. Unfortunately, these two models are ill-suited for the development of large systems that require more than, say, 20 programmers. We argue that there is a qualitative difference between the interactions among a small, “family” project and a large, “city” project and that this qualitative difference requires a fundamentally different model of software development environments. We illustrate the city model with Inscape/Infuse and ISTAR, the only two environments we know of that instantiate this model, and show that there is a pressing need for further research on this kind of environment. Finally, we postulate a state model, which is in need of further clarification, understanding and, ultimately, implementation.","inCitations":["99b310114449a4b70c609fa25f764d3c999a0fa4","98d90a98c7c38875c587f35600ec58b7bc65b936","6889a2a0168e6e995c72f2111d24b71f0b6d25b9","741cff98fc4c423c27456f6e04db8a8da629af11","0959bb59b82ed3d7930cd759b3c8d4b562ab0827","e2ca4899126210ea71ae59bb358c74e5b722e23c","3ee053f35ee97732f49b1fdcaba29fc664537273","dac12f0abfe2bcf51a129a92d52b62a9eaf65994","40b4b0dc74d66f64f5c3af89a8c252d515b7a765","e76e13363b983ecac09b1fa9b47a3e033d768daa","a6843ec5c841bcc8d643705c99836b3a36b71697","124b7f1bba34e2265675552273f9faab307f97ec","1ddfd5bd171c9cbecee967f7a0c35a3992513fab","18bf2fb98a33f8ce714a6df33d791f4aaa76be4b","1a6a6d71d515881a8518503ebf0f8590fbb2bc54","2fb820c29f2369c3057190791c839d00c013ce25","04caa2da4100603ca57f3808ef174dd7ea993d21","71792154da47974705586bfec9af8e53e6811941","6a707e9a30c1ca55fe50f9bef34fe4f624d8077e","0bbc8500f54c974155a17c6a856b413a7b4cfe3d","5325082b44e87c9d9ba188126d58b5dac31ac3c0","46e580cf7671a1b0cf2a53c05491207c89f6d5fe","d8909cb81a288a417d4fce83a0396aae97978fa7","c1f360a1fdffe57a5009f1402eab910c83bba599","33e18fb33666faac8b3234088e1837a355fa117c","21e971681d96690718a9af0bc83fcb3b8815784a","b97028cf49c19e935437f6598cb420885f6cb555","2f11e2abfd83e4e36756e6f12320620ca9961fd5","31fa355d5e8783575975c0f7b4aa57816640106c","1842a3f32c2e8d0cd8614f9479fe41fb0443fa38","c8dd829051022012866dc6ff4c872aff49a944c6","767cbcdbcc212926088087af71f0866434c86f08","7aef15b57082fb584a7cac3055ffc6bbc9db7eac","b9eba02c2533efdbec0adf4f9f2abb1eb908f911","0a62fd49d21d42968c27d2956fb0b0670616165b","d4ddc873d9727fe22655ec98d55b7bf5b1fa4b8e","dd5d89069c2ec3805972129e8c617e04c4c0daa8","e2fe23ab350dc9e925bcaceef29fc05ae97dd93b","49eed9aad2412af30bfad2adc39a13b23ab0fa78","137bee32342c7f3f772c1dccd2850a9ceff59d51","8debb482a3297b543e578adb3725b07e5e999b7e","52137f62f7e016563b8816cadb9e951caf304193","49db62b68bb6ca7691a248a87545a4ae8777f914","10554ed036f8e4e21a468e8b0d204fbebe271342","02c1a50b7a4092a2155c41c58f9f888b31ede2fc","7fa9103382866ae92a6958517fd9297b9e9bfd7b","4bb6967e302bbd98d76e728b34033e789aeedb08","f67b65c79c355037ba2aab5d8e559c9369d86a9e","4c8b9ebc050fad3053e26276351b91c3cc6233e0","544a75443e6cee087cfba2ca7efacb277470e5c0","5f33481e2f3733bb2d3091eef6e358b856d25c3e","027977d96f35d9ca45eea51eacf2090b50f9a73d","0bb61a5d15619b14b1806516532344d720adec83","67a7b72969ebd2463502a5d4e8560a0c70f29e56","9af13847b019823dc8589b68f93793d3918f21b9","58925cd47ec01430c3d46e37fa1bc797807a6ec5","348c7b1e2736f547e962321e14266c9828108ee8","e28e8d43fb6dd0b3049b2c969d1ce5eeac9e874c","0b58615572b41a3b8f2a0dc79495a5e10b945003","d5831fd11ebd3aa4df9c104bc91b6651ec264628","13ba26a0f067656274b263e5bf7b00d4d4e53a93","2f6300643d00916fd66e8c7658db372ea80c29b4","218760de0f793bbbfa7fc77f3343ec2542d5f6cf"],"pdfUrls":["http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry///work/papers/icse10.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry////work/papers/icse10.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/tse17-3.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse10.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry////work/papers/tse17-3.pdf","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse17-3.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse17-3.pdf","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse17-3.ps.gz","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/32.75417","http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:110903/CONTENT/cucs-512-89.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=55830","http://www.it.murdoch.edu.au/research/working_papers/cs9405.ps","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse10.ps.gz","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse10.pdf"],"title":"Models of Software Development Environments","doi":"10.1109/32.75417","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.75417","venue":"ICSE"}

Little attention is given to how to change and modernize existing systems, i.e., the theory and practice of software maintenance and reengineering. This paper presents the author's experience in teaching software reengineering in a masters-level course at University of Leicester, UK. It presents the course objectives, outline and the lessons learned. The main lessons are: first, there is a big shortage of educational materials for teaching software reengineering. Second, selecting the suitable materials (that balance theory and practice) and the right tool(s) for the level of students and depth of coverage required is a difficult task. Third, teaching reengineering using toy exercises and assignments does not convey the practical aspects of the subject. While, teaching with real, even small size, exercises and assignments, is almost infeasible. Getting the balance right requires careful consideration and experimentation. Finally, students understand and appreciate this topic much more if they have previous industrial experience and when they are presented with real industrial case studies.","inCitations":["f7fff11b562c22ba9e0c89a0b64eff5fda6a3fe0","afa721ca7cd279d66f2d4b0e1b1d517f52e199b6","ab286f498acddd1528d481e2ceb1b6c31d66ca97","5c5c1453260bc17c57bbcee7e31fd9d025a0e83b","6ec0cb05ef3e0344ed5f121ebca6c8e906b11160","a5d8fd6ac4e2004f8a063e57fd0aaf27bcdabe7c","3feeaa86f2cd526ae88792fd270cd82723a6719f"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134395","http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/mer14/ICSE06.pdf","https://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p699.pdf","http://reversingproject.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/experience_in_teaching_a_software_reengineering_course.pdf"],"title":"Experience in teaching a software reengineering course","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134395","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134395","venue":"ICSE"}

The ratio of complex errors to simple errors gradually increases with continual testing. This paper describes a software reliability model called the Error Complexity Model.

The number of remaining software errors is estimated from the ratio of complex to simple errors and the number of discovered errors. New criteria for error complexity classification are proposed. The model is evaluated and compared with existing models using actual error data.","inCitations":["8dc6f2b0e84910d2349de72e34b6a62cbe6fce8f","3d95868b3409e0afb5b0ce82b18466512b7ee30e","4b8ae9a08c0e293c2e8a56238e631bbd93a79d1b","0c5edf38c341d8c5524d5dcfd4277f4afc035b58"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74618"],"title":"An Error Complexity Model for Software Reliability Measurement","doi":"10.1145/74587.74618","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74618","venue":"ICSE"}

From this, the kind and the number of the necessary tests can be derived.

For example, web services interact with each other through XML strings. Database applications interact with a database through strings of SQL statements. Sometimes these interfaces between different software applications are complex and distributed. For example, a table in a database can be accessed by multiple methods in a database application and a single method can access multiple tables. In this paper, we propose an approach to understanding software application interfaces through string analysis. The approach first performs a static analysis of source code to identify interaction points (in the form of interface-method-call sites). We then leverage existing string analysis tools to collect all possible string data that can be sent through these different interaction points. Then we manipulate collected string data by grouping similar data together. For example, we group together all collected SQL statements that access the same table. Then we associate various parts of aggregated data with interaction points in order to show the connections between entities from interacting applications. Our preliminary results show that the approach can help us understand the characteristics of interactions between database applications and databases. We also identify some challenges in this approach for our future work.","inCitations":["ea0209968d8c8f584350d5005539eb9a14a54515","0e668828802b35a91fa5171a4a1fc41c8fe24925","4b207a2e3bebebf093874e9ddbcb6811e110290f","2166b458f5a5b7b6f5ebdc66c1d7381279f7a608","c6927003d0c45427d59a573d935514ef51f177d4","466cb5260fb25200b73af71deca32af8bd1650d5","00a873e45c1429b9eaff5017ba3cd4ef4a1df050","db202b54a6ab84c89c813651c3f30de259d514c3"],"pdfUrls":["http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/publications/icse06er.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134447","http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/xie/publications/icse06er.pdf","http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~taoxie/publications/icse06er.pdf","http://taoxie.cs.illinois.edu/publications/icse06er.pdf","http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/taoxie/publications/icse06er.pdf"],"title":"Understanding software application interfaces via string analysis","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134447","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134447","venue":"ICSE"}

The CRT screen serves as a window through which a programmer can view and modify a “pretty-printed” picture of any part of a PASCAL program. The ALBE/P system differs from conventional screen-oriented text editors in that the program is stored as a PASCAL parse tree and the editing operations are designed specifically for the PASCAL language. Moreover, because ALBE/P is language-based, it will not accept programs with local syntax errors (e.g., ill-formed expressions) or global errors (e.g., undeclared variables).\n The system is also an effective tool for developing and maintaining application systems and subroutine packages in multiple language environments. Programs can be entered in Language-Neutral Form (LNF), a PASCAL subset with language features common to C, PL/I, and ALGOL. Then, ALBE will generate a PASCAL program to be run and debugged under the host operating system. When program development is complete, ALBE/LNF will generate equivalent programs for the desired target languages and operating system environments. Currently, ALBE/LNF supports PASCAL, C, and FORTRAN under VAX/VMS.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802555"],"title":"Beyond ALBE/P: Language Neutral Form","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

However, existing techniques have limited support for important classes of invariants such as disjunctions, which express the semantics of conditional statements. We propose a method for generating disjunctive invariants over numerical domains, which are inexpressible using classical convex polyhedra. Using dynamic analysis and reformulating the problem in non-standard ``max-plus'' and ``min-plus'' algebras, our method constructs hulls over program trace points. Critically, we introduce and infer a weak class of such invariants that balances expressive power against the computational cost of generating nonconvex shapes in high dimensions. \n Existing dynamic inference techniques often generate spurious invariants that fit some program traces but do not generalize. With the insight that generating dynamic invariants is easy, we propose to verify these invariants statically using k-inductive SMT theorem proving which allows us to validate invariants that are not classically inductive. \n Results on difficult kernels involving nonlinear arithmetic and abstract arrays suggest that this hybrid approach efficiently generates and proves correct program invariants.","inCitations":["e67d7518a891735eb88f78bad6fdb020a0b3b2f9","32230fc3c06679474528fc74fd6cc5e189019bd3","04c376ab73f0473f6abdf84d9924328def92297f","0cea632ba131756bf69ba6cbd086c8e9daa57abf","1b09b56428af015643ea5eb63883f0c2045d3833","881dfc26bcc0063ed485e2af4ddbe85907ac3edb","ff47af5531e55c7b88879ed10c8b0203e5948d99","2f67dd61580d4c7167993708d4dedbcb12d968f2","1bab9c29090757e871915e22b8a53cb296710b86","d06a8d2843cd1f5d1a9e3a8f437c14f34d1d5778","b5772b7150d5212735bbaf7fd0412d4052e93844","7568336ed1cc9c1df91a9ae8b5a4977cc8d93e8f","0087a6a18440db9a8a37a68d5cc81543f0260b9a","ae8e30651e1edf8646187b804d269a0fd3663f16","df6f80499e4ac1900a8168c8312ac3bc9eb407bf","0c69ff6d4fb566b2f57d3f2bad7726ceae9476fe","96e66843615728d079e372fc22417e0a6cb71a3e"],"pdfUrls":["http://cse.unl.edu/~tnguyen/Pub/icse14_pres.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568275","http://www.cs.unm.edu/~forrest/publications/icse2014-final.pdf","http://qosbox.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-icse2014-preprint.pdf","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-icse2014-preprint.pdf","https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-icse2014-preprint.pdf","http://cse.unl.edu/~tnguyen/Pub/mpp.pdf"],"title":"Using dynamic analysis to generate disjunctive invariants","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568275","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568275","venue":"ICSE"}

Stronger guarantees, regarding the intended semantics of the service, would help, especially if formalized in a language that allowed effective, automatic and static checking of compatibility between the server and the client’s service descriptions We propose an approach based on a family of formalisms called description logics (DLs), providing three examples of the use of DLs to augment IDL: (1) for the CORBA Cos Relationship service; (2) for capturing information models described using STEP Express, the ISO standard language used in the manufacturing domain (and a basis of the OMG PDM effort); and (3) constraints involving methods. While traditional formal specification techniques are more powerful, DLs offer certain advantages: they have decidable, even efficient reasoning algorithms, yet they still excel at modeling natural domains, and are thus well-suited for specifying applicationand domain-specific services.","inCitations":["8055a13714cdb24f29f9e7a8c3f441014d2c9f9b","17acbd1f6d924d533342f07ccc788db081aa49f6","3ed195d5dfc45d26d1c105c64a90994194a7f412","83a5762895f6e69cc93249c2727c08494c76f6f1","4e3e477aae63f9b8b0f501f18005e3bc7e0dee4f","f7a9385d9dd6c25c28cd086bcb90f60624ab6023","80fe46cb2dfe73313bae0ed825d7084ce31ae466","1ba21661a92a6772e736867837295430f1891210","a24b68caf9e05abc4b84172d81ebcee99807eb4e","41cf56251d61cb0864d8553720c731a42d3f9e79","5d91618d1ef696deed8dc6980c06a1e48ca67297","005b170ddb6cad5f27aa8306c0a2a9e19a5108ef","b4ac4b0a6c7f2a101abe9c42f16e1075537f1cc2","fddb70373e055cf33b44c3d0288f35b040bc6d11","3ce3895aa518e478788a92214b136a36667ec4eb","2fbc03af92775dc3f4d8277b2f5c26dc730825ee","d0674114ce2d817b0c868ebad12afe2f73358a30","7735f23328d152ef296447f395868505bd879001","44df9597eb9db6a2eb53316a41c8ff040fde71bf","1e84c17cf92c490014f4391e11c89303ed37b794","08cd88b6c952453e133577fd807af303c8a3026b","82254f8c52629f77264f3a3feba10ccb21a32bfa","84283e1ea6545ed4d56bbb0da2f09c3df63ce94b","10d4deb768311c86c36112ef763352d7c4623615","30942116c8042c5554fd934e63b5e1f6ea220ac9","e225dd5accbc73d8a8133f06b66e4fc5479d61dc","0d2ddfcc4df2e33b7296577040303b247a75314f","94ab3c3039a52e01760e49841ab2fbacb561b8fb","9b5e5070a3a003da7811b4c941c7374d5a997a3b","062861589df08d065ed08685e5a734b6524d9254","ff26e63053757658bf82db01ff82eb20cf489db0","aa6dafd9216ec5b8f251d8d46db4c2efd2e781f0","22bfd93a49ac57a30f10ec7facceb2fc7ef4392c","f0ba05fe911243bd55bbffa90222bfa647245834","c2d9acec5e50da4c1f5e78733c7c4013546a7798","ae6b55133e3790bf0379c0cfdf485063eb8fc445"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/icse99-sub.pdf","https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/771/papers/icse99.pdf","http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/pub/borgida/icse99.pdf","http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/papers/pdfs/icse99-sub.pdf","http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/771/papers/icse99.pdf","http://castle.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/icse99-sub.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302660","http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/icse99-sub.pdf","ftp://ftp.cs.rutgers.edu/pub/borgida/icse99.ps.gz","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Premkumar_Devanbu/publication/2644990_Adding_more_DL_to_IDL_towards_more_knowledgeable_component_inter-operability/links/0deec51de3f2b28557000000.pdf","http://athos.rutgers.edu/pub/borgida/icse99.pdf"],"title":"Adding more \"DL\" to IDL: Towards More Knowledgeable Component Inter-Operability","doi":"10.1145/302405.302660","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302660","venue":"ICSE"}

Furthermore, software is created to fulfill human stakeholders' needs and wishes, and the resulting software is ultimately utilized (directly or indirectly) by human users. Today's software is highly intertwined with our lives, and it possesses an increasing ability to act and influence us. Besides the obvious example of self-driving cars and their potential harmfulness, more mundane software such as social networks may introduce bias, break privacy preferences, lead to digital addiction, etc. Additionally, the SE process itself is highly affected by ethical issues, such as diversity and business ethics. This paper introduces ethics-aware SE, a version of SE in which the ethical values of the stakeholders (including developers and users) are captured, analyzed, and reflected in software specifications and in the SE processes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449513"],"title":"Ethics-aware software engineering","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195075","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195075","venue":"ICSE"}

Competitive challenges, which are of major relevance for the growing number of software-based automotive innovations, are presented by a dramatic growth in system complexity, rising time and cost pressure, and high quality demands.All these requirements lead to a number of software-related challenges which will be of significant competitive importance for the automotive industry in the future. Asides from the question of whether an automotive company decides to develop software in-house or whether this is carried out by suppliers, every automotive key player has to hold or to build up specific software competencies. The most important competence areas are the software development process, software quality management including supplier cooperation, the overall architecture of the in-vehicle software, as well as the ability to specify, to integrate and to test the system.","inCitations":["f7079194cd0827da45ff5e9acf420d28e677a45e","858a553dfb4e14b836d98fa125e6354aff7740fa","1ab48197373f379dcd798cb8fc9b844a92b7507c","ea5b35cf158bda1f17a7ec6af1b47181236b46ca","235fb10ce671f315fc0e7d34d98db882333ce0b5","464107118c4dde29f911fce28214cff92e5918e9","d9ff86f06fb1a0de21571aac0827f2fcbf188da5","8dd3e431dd15877638defe096e23a45667f4109c","16fada4ac2f10c04851ae86c298ca46e7ed71f0e","20294cda815be9a6a66ceebcff56df392714f523","0a928cdb8e0cf36c858616fd11e69f81e6c25403","f64871aed5eca5f9f87523b1d0fb64ce2e6874ab","50f31f0146c4fa20e52fa79fd6427d98703823e3","bf39a19ff6d83ac2b32dbb26fe81894fcdff78b4","5f4a2ad4974689d75ebdf5fa2054c7d3c30a122c","c05a46775bbf10ac8cd8617298eee715c82790ec","01575dc6a1423b7fe215686b3011f2a171cb600b","b96dcfc0619f5c14d4987d516451d7d190e134fc","8b640fcd9cc46aa17b6f8bd0cfeaeaff21234d16","7832cd366e94858676d9b7f22ec6c430058004be","3997f08affb2088ddd8af00f323a0eaf18d7449f","1a1b7972b9516ab6c9c5bba094a7ec4487d24a72","54093d1f277e212e41ff62b8c7af9cdb49ce9964","306cee8e5879dff5bc0007c70e6ef2c48744f060","0e6cc4ac7637837ea6db3594fe3efeb52be3123b","52bb13b7acac13155221b1449353d8065d10255f","641b1b2447410a183f7d00145fd18e7854a46f6e","745e44e3b93546a84a283fde16cae74e73955c92","edeaabbd72fe43492deb4b58d9ffe289ea8e46b0","4c11d158bf20c9b52cfae6512305174db8837cd4","96f64a156f5876490c95a43f9bb022e21a87bb9a","016c798942abed7fc3475f3de7eafa084cf519eb","4249841917d840c759136f4b272ea89ebef015ea","1208e311b935eb1e5f3ce77123f951a5d4c92198","a2f96ded91948416dd543d13b921ea32e55d1ded","84a54e3f9bc3e071059d5208bee459e9b437a2b8","d8ee7b72d0f5baaa95efff600680adaa3bec2b30","3b19f0575d38cb15767d0b6746383ab65e95d9cd","9cd169c54e81fd4ee52f46755594594fb4f4f5ac","e49c621810ab444af9f4503ab0093cc7c414b12e","777543c2372fa2f122b0da04dd65981e6358eb6c","4cadf73c9e78b54ac177ba2fc60217d99426d1ef","a20ee74540a390d0be7cc8ad54f899a78df9ebc9","da40f90a531a71169994a7eb0c270d3219fc1fd7","e3b82570aa26e895da87eff931580fa1d9c75f24","387e9d801001541db4ab0f066e7a78ed63bae8d6","e4de8045a6713423b2e21f06ea081fabe6d233be","5ae8c16fc3249097aeaf12a56d804bc2e2e569ef","07adabf089ce7c4d164fb5a05a09e3ca70e838fb","5daba5cb8af66e16bef1ebe4572243c8266e9d66","d60b44e6b3355c5b362f69e5be756ea6bd914058","6463196bfe2cb1da9c2863886655ba1af8b952d7","3722a76f619e0569015285ce5ee544f53452a12c","7f8d6e67a627703b086d53b6ad34d43a81d6052a","1e99275958240f640345eb9c7ac43cc62b9cd9ab","680174dfe2ad62fd1c3375f35d76b97edce9f81e","8e14f974aa2c5c9d0caab192142f137c2e5b6041","823e82d60b6a8faae6855f3b81b5d45f6465bb82","f817c35d77c4587475a3b413621e454259e2f178","891aeca4311847b8615cd9970e9dbdb13d1f8a56","56d7a65332c98ade3d30db6628bba4f5d7b65a12","ab60836d5f56b7c132b915353d4a15412b234766","dcd1b4dd4148554db269828019d3df884c77fb1b","ef9ae99a4d7b77a793e69c2e0693bdc8608733aa","bcf9bfd65f7def7b26b0615fb67a4bc8980da32b","ff6c387f5f22c8f54c56a1989acccfe0c5f75c17","01c365c8b57c804ce4233b76cac9d4632f272492","2125ea6b9674eedf6052105b4ce5e8044dad6434","29635baf7366478100f606c15660eaa88e56f836","c293b8bf8b27f6e24b53b3b0434ca59a24c05825","1cfb42b4229b6f36d620ed67b87efb0b0ee69e94","10aac4932648f7e0d7b7bdb0156f65e238be1997","9e5bf3262d91e6dd685a982c4d4959d2b28b7bf1","9a6805aa812f0c2e84403c14ebca76bc58d8e9f9","0933e6f5260aa02d23f40e8f60001efabd431e52","a2ca434de7ccbe146347c28d15fc8762ad1d2061","e759c3c15d95988554c5b124506e3547b697ff4f","fc0d54c512fb6d3cf1052bbfcf4d3116a7a9d835","9339d4f822c60688039ab2c317de12b9d9aa8df0","7130af1ff638d47a6461371cdc95283944a1c2a4","a14ae16f44751a14c96d5e5c9147462cccd72c5a","ae9e73220d0f097da8a3195ca03dae764f33c1c6","67db9a07d1ff20dcca5210c09b63284f2e63fc95","771a264e325b5e4fc9edbb2e9f4c8e2bf070ef0e","f8012388623159c67ea85a13ca04edfababf3cfc","7bb82fc390a8e830bb1ea48fe3c0d9492b63d200","838d01b5d7bce775990bd4b4c7182f5df2b5a3e1","026bbf24dc1cc701f8e7e8b1d07f809c0847eecc","57663260aaf5f9e6533d2d99019d8c0d5eee81b8","06445f7fa40fa3fa100d0ee4493cb9ce32c5e1f0","c1290c93b1e09b1da40abe0e2f6743317bad6963","b898b063c3bbd544e501d1d943025e37d205ff24","3ea3fd57a7fe17174c0b3ae76f28e3b89bc7d73b","34e4b47b232fd7104e57882023939b8a56f41b8e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.spinroot.com/spin/Doc/course/p498-grimm.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776878"],"title":"Software Technology in an Automotive Company - Major Challenges","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

C&C views, which we have presented at FSE'13, can be used to specify structural properties of C&C models in an expressive and intuitive way. \n In this work we address the verification of a C&C model against a C&C view and present efficient (polynomial) algorithms to decide satisfaction. A unique feature of our work, not present in existing approaches to checking structural properties of C&C models, is the generation of witnesses for satisfaction/non-satisfaction and of short natural-language texts, which serve to explain and formally justify the verification results and point the engineer to its causes. \n A prototype tool and an evaluation over four example systems with multiple views, performance and scalability experiments, as well as a user study of the usefulness of the witnesses for engineers, demonstrate the contribution of our work to the state-of-the-art in component and connector modeling and analysis.","inCitations":["2958dfb3d35679d046d509b29d98e92174b8b0c2","5f6a3fc65828a3f89e21af5bceea4e03617a267b","e835cc6f57645d4df7c9b0453d02e0ea486b894c","dfab11026a65cbfeb7607f53953e800703046e9d","6e3c8f87201c34e9cead2dd95894df259fe5e2dc","4365f016db5eab24f8c8ff48c8da6a33a0cef03b","fe525b3092a0e0cff9cf74e45573a675e1460166","fe0b9f7ebf8d42361fcba5e35bee1af5f873df4e","c5b592c11cb816b6df46190fa105b1f9027893e2","fe4f21d0194ef5c0c3dd3addd3e91d7bc5d18fc3","92e1f5f7ba1aa5dadff4f3c59fdca3ac6c277473","c556f148555db65a534c41a72a9ec0bece2802bf","1489ed6cbb5ce91e7bfd7d38ed7e14e1a786a583","ace7b181b14cb5276b265c0089669f749760a7db","525bc6427a62e352d1ce1aec75e540d31175d519","f7840d2db376b9b69abac791f713044ace8670a0","03135088d9bb31ebb5a168418b0ae43c4133673f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Verifying-Component-and-Connector-Models-against-Crosscutting-Structural-Views.pdf","http://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Verifying-Component-and-Connector-Models-against-Crosscutting-Structural-Views-extended-abstract.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7136v1.pdf","http://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings239/110.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568237","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7136v1.pdf","https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1df2/6a9b4dc1891e442b0f8d6c0c133b5955f701.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7136"],"title":"Verifying component and connector models against crosscutting structural views","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568237","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568237","venue":"ICSE"}

Most of the research in this domain considers the body of the source code; trying to cluster together files which are conceptually related. This paper discusses techniques for extracting concepts (we call them “abbreviations” ) from a more informal source of information: file names. The task is difficult because nothing indicates where to split the file names into substrings. In general, finding abbreviations would require domain knowledge to identify the concepts that are referred to in a name and intuition to recognize such concepts in abbreviated forms. We show by experiment that the techniques we propose allow about 90% of the abbreviations to be found automatically.","inCitations":["ca9b82c08c00b09212cf5242881b9af2d47b2ad3","3943f13f3a11bf8fcf17a739552f42e31ac552cd","928e78ea8035a1d63a4926b43a6b4b58f916af7e","e1de04a8c5eeca055da3eee2dba6a65fc8c0371d","ac4d8f0c6b3e7659efc15f658e9022b470518210","dacf238d9f0c0c555a18d3ef2a3951d6276541df","a9e17e03c425660aa8436e602c3ac2741503c3c8","47e4f2b7a42ef26ec66967cfceb5b06c491d3d4b","0acfcbff8bf8c28334d5b37edcb64df8946a00fa","511928265dfea7010cde852009874e1cc20376db","5254364bfe90f39061d206a61d88e58e8ec7c2fe","abef785c35a07083c485c1c4f8b0d7a069db1547","0404b9f30bd1f7c3082e72076c433a17c29c5ed3","4b454de8be2c7f8233e3336a1e187b8012285856","a0553d8cc85d4626f4632dba74109f6865bf9c17","28768787c5228e22eb4b594b4592c68b7c437ca0","82500a7202294e9564ec590816be7dabdcdf091b","1797d0b16f3c2af394e80dbc75543b92e781267d","59c3941fc8e752be756c58efdee4fc2162e5fc01","99901f32be3a2162326d675d2f26ce2b44ea7164","a6362170d0b858a94fcbb53f02044e5cb5396833","22cac9eedc86b1c7e5b7a4821444c88b8fc1116e","26bdd453622fdebbcf2ed46b48a3bf98cb2230af","1620dbbd99b19a5818cb75f81ccd5afe18cc4d81","07fd128c23c567e37b72bb9511185bca111fc2d6","0c809e82f84154d55471e16e2e567d86f4b56e2b","ea374592978cb774d47747f19ff60085264216d4","fed20d02dc1f995f995244b7bddf1b1f272da7c4","2ba30cbcfed85ea8de0522280d3f7451c29dc1f4","0e49bec66b4ea719c1e0cd91486090e357b2bc80","e5c83781d325585d787022c9f1648245c2c11bb7","8742a2cf791839c1d3c48dc2ebb05db7157a6605","5257a2636746e9fd0b6ee2e602c33d2682f997fa","9bfde2fe856bbdbf30db2999c8de5b4855288842","b4bf77a9c16dc46e551e38660cb4a18672aa02ba","a9cf229eb23bd7c6bdcd8b50dc4a19a8530e574f","18ab8cf8352a00a46cbb49a2817f28833c9de0fe","5d201f2cac2ab0dab2bf98c9b4e54059a692bd7d","c3db5be2870ba544394bce24570f32f151892d60","aea162dc4df94a351a18004febc254a93438c3c4","3520b4be9500930426890a070a43869aa70cd196","6c638cb58f5a27a619a00dfef786848984ee1624","664a3c6eed68fe719b0819c1ffd7b07f7aebdf97","92ec07c2b62917c96be1d3d0c57a01b8c6ac7d1c","2aa48e6d215a775e452892dc397228a149efd65b","0b8eba05333826aa4694108392ef3e90f5049c76","18ca27565d2c715b33217261d894e87070ec892f","f2a9970ee20190dde62e150e919f25f070406124","f0e4063e1c981049404069bd5efa5d6fa3bf74d6","257eba8523849efb42887b2b4c14fbc61be57cdd","8a85d7ad3203b8a3a619a501908faa8b504b6067","49e4b398cd72e6e9a463627c969ed7cd77ef84c7","093db46d08384dbc156010f17289ae4a3ee7d626","326ab7b8b44b2bb0861fae83f2fd30d60678692d","100e7b6322c9455733f3ba62de9cf30201451f29","c70d6640e0c20b5e1d94d1dd87e27cda474db15c","bea030e3dc3e5fc99f4724dc425468317ceaf7ab","fe8343fbcb63d60922217277bf087a44583355ea","4a78ec97963037937637fc31b3262c39660bbbd9","99720b02dfe91bf5a79ac3f0cc510f1eadff2a83","618ad3376480912aed3b6418b2f05aef1a573695","6764a6f5e5c4bb4dff9d26cc244768d0baf821e8","30955c06e3696f3924cb1628ac0ce9852933911b","d1521a5a7ce6c7a6482b923e2e0d2fb63385e195","17212677c75ddc12c3635e6ea9e78d02f80c7fd0","4fe32b1f9afb690e588dd176ba3dd11274785e0d","1afc4eeb182d92631c3ce400e6999eebbca71c12","0b0996ebc0f365b05bfc7a2327912bb2aa4cbd52","69ec0357d9705561bb5029d2e97ef7e2809f99bb","256b5c8a3457c687c271965efaf84b5768951ee3","71eacbad8f68845761c6eebd929a8d529e5a15f8","966b993cd87d89a7c1cc921b6bb38eec4c882ed1","212f567fa16820ae9132b8b1e8d317abbc8a2ab6","3cfc0b445757a630e04cceaba3e401d1b2884629","38b88d87d1468086b261ff0003771c92d8b22ce4","9bab656b9644a80efb8f1b46c574ac75d570f48b","7a3cc62b960864354df76f87d796364109c31bc3","c9ba722322912419e59ea251c22b437d251f1644","5690e676f9227b37562105e351862815a4e5a214","1fdfdd921d24af5561ca856bd6d4568c6efd744e","5a42064c49c927b1f9baed6e78b5bed4cf5e7707","3f6fc1373c50699b5aa7c88c53b186fba60bc5d3","ab0ef2d8ccaed371e69e37c7f286940c7e097f73","2e1ecd1c00dd7dd049df7bdc79d665e2b586f6c6","ad5512f15d9e54d243abc7afac00633616aae5db","fd439ea61ec12fa0db210f614fb919647126b309","80fa5ffd84a8209d2c35579f43794d1da9fe3118","5b162facad8e94ae2381525be7461bf06f91151f","f2e588a723f3dec555d478fbeed19b9aa2e5cebd","937b2bd32ba19a8baea51b2376fab30534cd387b","1f6220bcf86f24af3499b1b660a391a14fc03cdc","5422ec2792f28b80a45deb90f18cb44a48ac8faf"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~tcl/papers/ICSE/ICSE98Anquetil.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671105","http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~anquetil/Publi/ICSE-98.ps.gz"],"title":"Extracting Concepts from File Names: A New File Clustering Criterion","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671105","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671105","venue":"ICSE"}

On the other hand, program development hand-in-hand with program-correctness proof techniques has shown promising signs for future software development. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between structured design and program development with proofs. Three basic constructs used in structure charts have been modified to incorporate guarded commands. Software design can be proved informally using the modified structure charts. With this technique, the benefits of both structured design and program correctness proofs can be applied to the development of large programs.","inCitations":["c615f96dfa03e1ad41c0eedba8dd030140d28fd5"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802009"],"title":"Structure Charts and Program Correctness Proofs","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Such models vary the ordering of process stages (eg., prototyping vs. a traditional waterfall vs. incremental building and releasing). Yet, in all such models the software process is bounded by those activities that initiate and terminate the development of a specific software product.","inCitations":["7e63e9b5cf7e0c96b7335bd955573b2334af0a5e","048c9bb3f7a7b77015b6fd54a9a152cbe9468e46","c2421123ed0c494c2011acbc7f890fba856687d1","4a43fad3466de740a9a55f851af995840f683ea0","2744f9b3dc7c8c587811ffd39dd1ce7015a72e82","faf796ed77c9ac46be80858bafa93b134650194a","0c6626f84eef9b7ef3d5a9e62ba4c266c1a2f909","0b84d6bec746605aa7582e6012d91073b686f5ba","184ca13b9b1d87615ac54a6b8e01cb0e1fdd049e","ab2484b397e685a52f20aecc669caa2e679b8f9a","1aaa43483de464c57239953598ad4df3a55d7bf0","381bd1c6a6851c57d0bbfe3e1c61307918936933","62de612c4ab5dcd3a36c29fe6994c4d8bf0d15f3","d5bf9bfb6f43059e855b97c4f61cefc32fbc2d37","d2ee05bcf4d20ffca40fd9e32bf4c7b1d75a0ac2","88e984bf154ed334a8d05bb7fae91dee39d77f24","03708e5756928d71fad50123057e98f5c9b84cd1","96848b7e2e72c0492a9bf2b4423ffabe71251f39","0baa3ae0f872e1c342e9a292d8d080b16000c3b0","9d15a5b62fae580cae7de3f3d924060e48789693","e8d57054ac28a8a264b9745280dd23230dcc64d0","1b6853c52a7ed9488f9e8ca22ee9f7d62b6e4ded","18404e5d8de3bde927c16853e84760db8c232228","65a6c950ebb0296462b15a7f5750ebd54f0b6d84","310c1cdda0059e79c037eb2b262c7da0c31e4ece","5013014a5fc1ea0e6a716d47c0a9a152150a0b54"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74643"],"title":"Three Problems Overcome with Behavioral Models of the Software Development Process","doi":"10.1145/74587.74643","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74643","venue":"ICSE"}

Software domains such as the ones mentioned above, are inherently knowledge-intensive but this domain knowledge is often hard to detect in the resulting application. This is because the domain knowledge is not separately and explicitly dealt with, but implemented together with the implementation strategy of the application. This also results in changes to the domain knowledge propagating to the implementation strategy. Hence, current software engineering practices result in software applications where domain knowledge is implicit and tangled in the implementation strategy, thus encumbering understandability, maintenance, adaptability, and reuse. A second problem is that the development of software where domain knowledge and implementation strategy are tangled is a very complex task: the software developer who is typically not a domain expert has to concentrate on two aspects of the software at the same time, and moreover manually compose them. This violates the principle of separation of concerns [5] [9], that states that the basic algorithm should be separated from other concerns or aspects.","inCitations":["f8e14c0a613a8edb659f75eca2d367356b4220bc"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581477"],"title":"Making software knowledgeable","doi":"10.1145/581339.581477","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581477","venue":"ICSE"}

It has been observed by multiple consultants, researchers, and authors that inadequate requirements are a major cause of accidents involving software-intensive systems. Yet in practice, there is very little interaction between the requirements and safety disciplines and little collaboration between their respective communities. Most requirements engineers know little about safety engineering, and most safety engineers know little about requirements engineering. Also, safety engineering typically concentrates on architectures and designs rather than requirements because hazard analysis typically depends on the identification of hardware and software components, the failure of which can cause accidents. This leads to safety-related requirements that are often ambiguous, incomplete, and even missing. The tutorial begins with a single common realistic example of a safety critical system that will be used throughout to provide good examples of safety-related requirements. The tutorial then provides an introduction to requirements engineering for safety engineers and an introduction to safety engineering for requirements engineers. The tutorial then provides clear definitions and descriptions of the different kinds of safety-related requirements and finishes with a practical process for producing them.","inCitations":["b5e8200c4fcc23fb3d31fd211c8ab6064ca87e7d","39add34c02ade5a789f85a2bd88136bb3e55da26","8b8e3fa6230eb25c93198ee76d01fd64405ad651","4253a7f0288be6a15f84a8641f350482d9d5f5a6","1f053b471db272b253dcd75a08bd4753db4cedf9","888bcab5ad5fa16f6b827e3caab496bed0609c43","b4890d09a4797e5a277dbfbb012ae76c72440260","0b825ca022fd95d14c3bae5c141343322528b15f","fab1496c62b965efaedc92479bea5906f3b0d377","4b0d3d5ee2ec2b4696cc88d7913d2c9baa6ec412","93b77c9448fe8683cd66d1d068dd88f7cfa8970a"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134498"],"title":"Engineering safety-related requirements for software-intensive systems","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134498","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134498","venue":"ICSE"}

Even if an organizational promotion system is established, the SPI activities of each development department cannot be promoted effectively without SPI community. To promote SPI activities throughout the TOSHIBA group, we organized a Corporate Software Engineering Process Group in April 2000. We also have been focused to establish SPI community, while promoting SPI activities in each development department. The fundamental our operating policy of SPI is \"bottom-up\". This paper discusses the problems encountered in the promotion of SPI activities and presents solutions to the problems. The actual results obtained show that the framework and solutions developed by us can be used to effectively promote SPI activities.","inCitations":["70bcfedae4982faed0b2ba3fc165abd184397887","9b2843617dcc10a0b20ac8f6d44352979bb3678a","67b7893bc55bb287538b928d811fa113518da5b8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p595.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134369"],"title":"Practical approach to development of SPI activities in a large organization: Toshiba's SPI history since 2000","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134369","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134369","venue":"ICSE"}

Recent empirical studies indicate that software engineers can support the goal of reducing energy usage by making design and implementation decisions in ways that take into consideration how such decisions impact the energy usage of an application. However, the large number of possible choices and the lack of feedback and information available to software engineers necessitates some form of automated decision-making support. This paper describes the first known automated support for systematically optimizing the energy usage of applications by making code-level changes. It is effective at reducing energy usage while freeing developers from needing to deal with the low-level, tedious tasks of applying changes and monitoring the resulting impacts to the energy usage of their application. We present a general framework, SEEDS, as well as an instantiation of the framework that automatically optimizes Java applications by selecting the most energy-efficient library implementations for Java's Collections API. Our empirical evaluation of the framework and instantiation show that it is possible to improve the energy usage of an application in a fully automated manner for a reasonable cost.","inCitations":["5f95b11a6c00695cd3c1d7774cde0c377c3b8b50","c2d64eb24d4183a90b2301a707369a7e8c91920f","32744d3920563c96ea9aaa6186c14933e6f262b4","ddc9b4b17fa31debb424b888337bafa9f40c3286","b858bacc7b1a41a7cf18939651a02ad0ebf46631","faaf851c760dd86acb2ad4314a739ca9128bf4b0","25e9823815a6d9f74e9b2c2af3aa8157763a840e","8ba369a1aedbf1c09c20782c4b4d5e5996ea1c78","f547452982009465d552a2defef387f85a0c76b8","c26ff79189d1c06080a53427857dab3556f9d6fb","989eab411b6a03ef2813fd12d1cb83f9af8909ef","a580b1076a3a7b137e811ef3ab4717d1cb1fd454","361a7c27a390fd5bfb4344b2c08c65c73e7eb2a2","6a9dd83d3cf53ee972fcde85c99111d8852d4d9d","f3cb1025720610e2521c926a5f817ace7da08304","108ed454273a34528a9d55fe467c10723417d4d5","27f661ea52d7f42036207dea1dc600de07b7e7ea","554b8b80361179bc3c9627fc6ccccd20c7257da2","1076820ea04a7e07b5db13cb11bfe04d1ee20672","eed647284425aad525f0babecee51b53f06009b2","64cc4ef5def3919049bdd3a645af198922d626c2","2d8721c1604493cf19f18f8f4cf7e770e3d3d25a","0f95717ff75d4e02cc7c981765cfb41115fadf89","c37326b791940b515553fd400e635642c0d574cc","bdc65d008760f77b9a3c8eb83b3cd22ca02216f8","93e23950b26840af0cebe0c9b992f9a970727e14","da6353163c1fa35a9a117bba885cefdd9de9f51a","a36d63768df69e6167a448ed62106b9abc8787b3","601f2bc197a5bbcedb4f6e248658538cb60b6b6b","c173932643c1fcc1cfa5a072f17fda531485a0aa","79fba0209bccdcbca572e2c546252425c58d7c5b","88ad24379af225fc09a841e9fb64ce5eabd4e842","cdda9d0cf1d47b46f6c4fba140f1fa2da584eafd","d8fae4efdb8514d019086cc5c9bea69c5406661b","d69167fa4da21eece07671810291fd1d1b0dba1c","f045e0be233f7ccfefab6404d9d51411f560dc27","bed304c104e431a1e4ffe5da9a56cf3b82049d00","2f13df0ee3e72f83664a7ee239193d4e4f7525a3","66fdbf3333eb25c8d07ca1b7b4931f7b58f5c13d","1cd109abaf849050fd617d2ac36ba14c64a1e2c6","798d05714f7520100073ec81e8426a21c6ca1973","07624056d7ed804021288fce18845eda0411ecd2","56e465269a89f8d519f0178f22157d712323ac39","075f8503878bb9ceaa243e7872f9840b1388922c","55f0e7cd10c26636d382e850c4a33e60d1125934","a5d6a955d9ee2fc93e58a47ceac5c118fa36aeff","7515e77f5d1bedf72e7ca57a71361a51fe2b32cc","1c8fe13b1991090dcf9da504341673b08436111d","158637e4d886c6b540541133f8357ff9f4a6765c","188de87f67e06a6d46d0444bf5da739c5349d1a6","ea138fa0b812ab43bc54f762c41a6ae84df453ab","28108d5f8c31bc78e5170b1e83a60489ad1275ba","05cc1fde7246f462e3221c65c9725186d022f96e","bc6a48395170b5187f8837b407aea0ab4ad30854","5cb5abf0eb226daedfa3a4f261ed289fb6046b06","0ab15188144b3fb176045d04421e4a89474080a6","d739cb7be2821cad0664e9abbce273676ed13feb","76dd6ce180985fa15e448a497a2d2450247ff576","132d134b5e0a6be45ed3aa64ee6f351dc2b6f3fa","256e8025fed55c29b993388789f7c737e8730985","83d3685a11e8f4855047dd3fba11a67b45aab935","5fc83e22dab753b2c593519fd40cd0689258e068","74c1b4ca9e5d1aed16808048a679f2188040811a","93430235c86605bcb0665d96eb5d51410c2bce7d","b8f335d74ad57896014aef3aab311853625eb521","05a8efd96d60ad83b4505ac8dd4328cadcf72645","5f5c3cadfbc6f746bc544ec7fb510e6cbf1781c4","59e8aaba6a955a4e7382223e29d31b64aa6502cb","da986080ad454a32b69132e68bd5602890312340","2b1b3fa2e9e2c57dfcca772865e12f2dc18b9c10","8804f9f13d9c12e548f2ca062f8cd9af367d65a4","6f5f38a1858ecf08138dce583d8c757697606308","ca89b4612deff8a152a77719b8424fc7783fd62a","fe7b0936e116096f1e865ce734a343e1628cd11d","692d49213cddb14488b3f16c1015495865499b83","691adf793dfa95eac8c14e284cd546e9ddb6d47b","d9b3697e6c681c893c6a103a41878835d1bc68d4"],"pdfUrls":["http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cow/39/slides/COW39_Pollock.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568297","https://hiper.cis.udel.edu/udsacl/lib/exe/fetch.php/seeds-sigsys-prelims-im.pdf","https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~manotas/preprint/paper_379.pdf"],"title":"SEEDS: a software engineer's energy-optimization decision support framework","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568297","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568297","venue":"ICSE"}

Respondents to the survey deseribed what techniques they use in estimation of software costs and, in an experiment, each respondent estimated the size and cost of a speeiflc piece of software described in a design document provided by the authors. It was found that the majority of the technical staff estimating software costs use informal analogy and high level partitioning of requirements, and that no formal procedure exists for incorporating risk and uncertainty. The technical staff is significantly better at estimating effort than siztx however, in both cases the variances are so large that there is a 30 pereent probability that any one estimate can be more than 50 percent off.","inCitations":["52faa600e9bbb7eb4d6978acd90b42e900e02960","d33ca44933dc4ea3eabdf07b35e959a5ebff260f","19b202096651bde2f5adbf0373a8d7a6d1ef8697","822c4b3ec141db192068f7671c9208aa4dbbe536","c8ae4e55747bcfd0217b8ecefce5ecea1df2b2b2","7bd0924147db5c6392c7496e4c3a47e4b979ebc3","910c42fa39785bf636bfe6d0e5db6cb2287800e1","bccd942718afb162ea4a8dc83bcb4c0e3e6f0d74","45751098641a067f3eb7aa4b5d0ee31fa668e2bf","be592d228575ca0635bc85f76cb87932771be847","55c87eaf0d32af89323dad479f6e5d0d34dead1a","13bd05573978fba7b53aed1d162d603e37b09d33","d25437795f6f0faed17c4c6551f7b1b2a85a657d","63b108965ea2cb10749364f259ae68ad566ff3b2","c17c9be9c848a0ef5709ca7e23cd67a0062eeca2","64b74986087e0f128b9eb80701631e6ebea60913","71f7b603cb89016159333d9609fc1df76f1bfd67","63bf8c7bd40dba71c59834c47bad023b5dd87ec1","3a8681678f7ead36463423d9edf4047638693895","6e28290a170e7bef34e44c978e08932cc676362a","f2c4b389919d1fb0170b8a72fe58b638e001d9e7","4b1eb6d237d94caccd86f4a6e09f0983052f856c","df1c5fb85025256a4409fe6c718ac2355b5fbb07","1ba2b2a382e2593d4ec3dab39e61d47123afc37b","41cacaf64d54a905a6437095de18630a73ac9038","23db4d22bd9a42155556a5a3bcbf1c768e0289d2","65439654df3cb3760d13939fb645ae92e7917176","3fc4af0f608334042802727a7c3631ad2f352022","14c23295ace73dd1b07cb4d6befa75809d7fcff7","bd7770b678ff623319117311f672c5e7e062b28a","792308caa524d68f38f3ed8f8895a3ca4d014772","f7b9ade3f3cf99b1443f1568c4e32746abdbfdf5","728df1ae6c64a8022cadea3f176492be6fbad2e9","70756cd091ee0e951a4a599ce6a4847e3a0818ae","32ea178e648d260487e68d7cb10b76c9cda4e989","19b96880c34bd1974b9fa8b2a61b8b5de86b97a4","363d59536b73c33e78248fa6a8407912f142439c","e8597f938e5158ab2015a69c45b6f0fbddb9955c","09548e098462a10e4be3349b80064ecc66e9f4bd"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.itu.dk/people/mpo/p276-hihn.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=256664.256780"],"title":"Cost Estimation of Software Intensive Projects: A Survey of Current Practices","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The semantic integrity of a data base is said to be violated when the data base ceases to represent a legitimate configuration of the application domain it is intended to model.\n In the context of the relational data model, it is possible to identify multiple levels of semantic integrity information. Relation constraints comprise one such level; they express the semantic information not contained in the structure of the relations nor in the identity of their underlying domains. The three components of a relation constraint are considered: (1) the assertion (a predicate on the state of the data base or on transitions between data base states), (2) the validity requirement (the occasion(s) at which the assertion must hold), and (3) the violation-action (the action that is to occur if the assertion does not hold at a time when it should).\n A framework for relation constraints is presented. Details of a structured classification scheme are outlined. This scheme is intended to form a basis for a high level, well-directed, and disciplined methodology for the design of relational data bases.\n Emphasis is placed on the assertion component of relation constraints. Assertions are viewed as more than expressions of some relationship among different values in a data base; assertions single out the data that is constrained, and state the properties that this data must possess. A classification is provided of the various predicate types used to identify constrained data and to state the properties which they are to possess. Approaches to the relation constraint assertion specification process are discussed.","inCitations":["e1fe0772c0aa1b8017d3e274b28d47c71894425e","c7fdd630db0794a832e99285f21ad09501db331e","5dae7a860e0ba5f7e718ba1b2f9766c2c0bcdf25","557d3aaa6c5f9bbdf4aa982441a66b8006cbe08b","e998e47abffd33ba0dac791500a99e450535b3ef","ff71e065fd2e2a43f4fee79470051358d820b27f","e4831a26298f65119efe37b63b5bc27a5998c787","ebdd3d2e70fd90abc675dfe7046fd1e75094cb75","d4a8e93f004c86267eead89edecbd332518dbf21","440e314a599e16c7559285285828cdf3490cb6ae","628357a058fa0242fc85475167c3e60c67e99eb4"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807724"],"title":"A Framework for Data Base Semantic Integrity","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The combination of interface extension and specialization constitutes a powerful and expressive incremental modification mechanism for describing changes that do not override the behavior of the parent, although it may introduce new behavior.\nConsider the case when incremental modification is applied to both a parent specification S and a parent algorithm A. A proof that the child algorithm A′ implements the child specification S′ can be built incrementally upon simulation proof that algorithm A implements specification S. The new work required involves reasoning about the modifications, but does not require repetition of the reasoning in the original simulation proof.\nThe paper presents the technique mathematically, in terms of automata. The technique has already been used to model and validate a full-fledged group communication system (see [26]); the methodology and results of that experiment are summarized in this paper.","inCitations":["6f8f12b8996273806ed7147d8b34e10167a7ee6a","2bf6f74dc10bc4824a960d2e4551723f02ba0740","9667fb4ecd0508481596ca9a6ca43c6347675d71","a3983dd15b24f8f6345314ba4c4e34397f7a45f0","46e7ccccebe5f3d3ba8dc06ebb0be7980994fba4","5955536518d54f98a2e9dc37d4dda9c872a793c9","70e7666620da74a26bf5e9917534ccbd8fe55850","07c2f84d3c118122a64325ae2e558681fd83c173","0cff4e18cab1a66922f6d0607007db5bdd44038b","7c6035e33bb6bcc01dad3a23345e6ecbd2634f8a","0b64cba8373e5b36a46f5e64040a971092218df8","5ee45e0093271c99a235107b93833be6c5b510bd","74247c35ef12349dba77ab49f1af8ccc95421a40","d255dfaceffb683ae1eb25275afd9c1a3c8878b7","02b03ab9d1fec3f5ec2ba1a0369617faac2a3819","08d65ac26d9b0f3968654b1672dc19dc4f883fcb"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337358"],"title":"An inheritance-based technique for building simulation proofs incrementally","doi":"10.1145/337180.337358","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337358","venue":"ICSE"}

The intended tutorial participants are experienced object-oriented programmers and analysts who want to improve the adaptability of their models and programs. The design patterns described by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides [l] in 1994 ensure that a certain system aspect can vary over time. In this tutorial we help the participant recognize an underlying principle common to many existing design patterns, namely the ability to allow the implementation of an object or class to vary dynamically. We present a key concept in supporting dynamic evolution: the context class. At the design level we present a simple extension to the Unified Modeling Language [2] for describing context classes. At the implementation level we demonstrate how to develop Java [3] programs using context objects. We demonstrate how context objects can be used to easily model and program patterns such as the Adapter, Bridge, Chain of Responsibility, Decorator, Iterator, Observer, State, Strategy, and Visitor. Tutorial Content We present techniques for achieving dynamic behavior in a static, class-based model and language.

In order to begin investigating such claims, we examine the development process of a major open source application, the Apache web server. By using email archives of source code change history and problem reports we quantify aspects of developer participation, core team size, code ownership, productivity, defect density, and problem resolution interval for this OSS project. This analysis reveals a unique process, which performs well on important measures. We conclude that hybrid forms of development that borrow the most effective techniques from both the OSS and commercial worlds may lead to high performance software

Scherlis","ids":["1799909"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Structural change in a large system is hindered when information is missing about portions of the system, as is often the case in a distributed development process. An annotation mechanism called promises is described for expressing properties that can enable many kinds of structural change in systems. Promises act as surrogates for an actual component, and thus are analogous to “header” files, but with more specific semantic information. Unlike formal specifications, however, promises are designed to be easily extracted from systems and managed by programmers using automatic analysis tools. Promises are described for effects, unique references, and use properties. By using promises, a component developer can offer additional opportunity for change (flexibility) to clients, but at a potential cost in flexibility for the component itself. This suggests the possibility of using promises as a means to allocate flexibility among the components of a system.","inCitations":["165142a2833d45c01e05d3d2d59aa2036ba2bc58","094daab9aa5544e2ebfd7a972368053b1dd0c342","fd6b662b341df3f3dc4fbfc285c4a02cb8b0919b","398c6445659904c92070103b69f5c96104e2ce6e","680d4bc0ffec72039b8c4cd9e884c99e3ee9f64f","175e6a0413144eb0f5fb0dc82cb7f257ae70fb4a","91b939b0ed18d8500fac452794eac3bcb8ea5e11","d672facd20c895779c4010459ea2e5fbb70f5f2e","41639da89938f4d8a160bd7a2f3d890e51a18bf1","56f8993bdbbcfa612b8690ede8bea8a8cdaa7134","48a89a719651263c5cdd93b396e03f10843ee0d7","0977d59e7ee3a6d35b62912a1b1ab9f2404a7ead","5116dbb577dba681434531050b1e205dd4be939f","bf9f334b96767e3a47dda046ac59665adf54fdf8","7883d7f48b364acd6f185197f4c70119fe514bbd","3000806d25bce6111b0007e84e733642d3ca2567","2853d71d45b01fb5f66987df4b8547096f1b8906","0e380927ea44b863a9eff171765dd81b2da39a5a","af61b8f0cc818217bb4a39cfdc71bf3eae5194f6","216fda518bbf4af20cc4284fb0eb5e6a9d3303ae","be9cdd83906fc52d11c97c5b923e478825ad22e5","77539d44b73f3e84bca585d309129e9a1a39bd2a","818a17ec2d12a75652b0ae7b575b6650ac6e6de5","9137b46b85b90bcaa487bd66f0de8148746142a8","07ece7e969a609ceecea354c211d794763d45dde","b1e57047f4434a0ae5368c3c0bfe18d0f3479be7","805049bb0c483ee51604a3f564adbbba3df4945b","4a2155080cb13cb4d714030a8813bcba8ca08e19","778001c10c18b98fefd5d505ea167d0102e96b98","ff2f2663b26e33645e3516dfab6a4d798731d1a3"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671113","https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590p/00wi/promises.pdf"],"title":"Promises: Limited Specifications for Analysis and Manipulation","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671113","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671113","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper describes the Prism model and an architecture that captures this model in its various components. The architecture has been designed to hold a product software process description. the life-cycle of which is supported by an explicit representation of a higher level (or meta) process description. This paper also describes the nine-step Prim methodology for building and tailoring process models, and gives several scenarios to support this description. In prism process models are built using a h&&d process m&telling language; which is baaed on a high-level Petri net formalism and rules. The Prism nrototvne has been imolemented on UNIX, GRAS database for an&ted graph structures, *and the Sunview user interface. An important observation to note is that this work should be seen as an infrastructure, or a stepping stone, for carrying out the more diicult task of creating sound process models.","inCitations":["511a3098f539dd0c7632dbf79dedc12aaaf634b6","0b58615572b41a3b8f2a0dc79495a5e10b945003","cac8316a64041369a71620b4f545acd9adb60b71","ded289d87c83399376c39646ea845c71ca6b7d5e","4afde55c38eb8907616f5511a571788a7c64cd98","06e35a24ef71120eb5be519ac21ff806d5f855bd","234397afcd5db2a9ac5c77a7ed15ffb1ef1ed968","509cef833808cf0a2b11d950bc44c9864eb9732c","7fa9103382866ae92a6958517fd9297b9e9bfd7b","23f0838fd92fc58c8a46d2bdace25227cbc370a6","dac12f0abfe2bcf51a129a92d52b62a9eaf65994","0936eb4d1f7e24a57166c65ec8ffb757b27b14f2"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=100336"],"title":"Prism = Methodology + Process-oriented Environment","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

In this paper, we present MintHint, a novel technique for program repair that is a departure from most of today’s approaches. Instead of trying to fully automate program repair, which is often an unachievable goal, MintHint performs statistical correlation analysis to identify expressions that are likely to occur in the repaired code and generates, using pattern-matching based synthesis, repair hints from these expressions. Intuitively, these hints suggest how to rectify a faulty statement and help developers find a complete, actual repair. \n We also present an empirical evaluation of MintHint in two parts. The first part is a user study that shows that, when debugging, developers’ productivity improved manyfold with the use of repair hints—instead of traditional fault localization information alone. The second part consists of applying MintHint to several faults in Unix utilities to further assess the effectiveness of the approach. Our results show that MintHint performs well even in common situations where (1) the repair space searched does not contain the exact repair, and (2) the operational specification obtained from the test cases for repair is incomplete or even imprecise, which can be challenging for approaches aiming at fully automated repair.","inCitations":["146ae24cea3c510e5698d39cdb7b18fb7e097b75","643de4fe3fcd960bea7b2491831308bc0febcef9","a5fc8efc8f198a599dbb06d5d51f73600b09685b","142f7a1b10b88e6c735ba0bae07465c7b131c1b4","68e42898d72e3408b6d2b5765e31152e15fde9fd","36d9943fd8f99d7b19c08ce945f05cb76fa04511","58bf5fd11d285bba1ef2053b003ed9b89df96a8d","19d29a59ef1b472102c540b178415489e0353b37","f7f9bb49b177e5350fd6c350c708c1ca37c59743","5a1232f92fc454c9ed5d9b16f299982760bc504b","8f1b9435cb60731aaeba193a2bd8e12e30448ba6","4380260a61d918f4298aa8e1a6169eb98281f840","be6635a96c020c7cdb7111b1a108305f040df891","3dc46fb813e664334cd33e6837877860eb62f2e9","6ada4de6b4c409fe72824bb48020d79aa7e8936a","309def6bec7b12cfbd4ce5bd97549ea4e6d6f742","8d3678fee42d911dfa23e05002c83fcdd0f00155","0474ce5b01f24a81b26afdfb7556b1099795bfba","a9ae89dd0867cf5fccfab375bbc160d9c8a144a1","361cfc9c8ef0a8eb45ad3a2dda9ccde5c0fa55c5","b2c92460ce35a518964f5c9a91c3497cfa1ece01","c2726eacd0a9f29668395ef0b56fdbab7bd3f013","502ebf6849fec9e0e6b4c106ebe6999e25d6bfc1","6c2e280585540773cca5e4e988610647d9e0f4aa","17d999204374431e2082bc1835cc38319f7de564","f6f0b8a040e51bcad745593eb55bbd929bd796c6","23d5ddd38c722c82f8c4666d9de12fa151ad584a","0c7fa407136ac1a455b05f6e051bbc7d80737aa7","0c3f6413b362992b5e7b6d20a6bd057ad18cf92f","aef6293a1381d97990864486ea6063609f2248c8","3f215e83b39a0887257a03274002f353c5a57537","66e4703024ef2f53f6c4a80547a92a2f27a7209a","cce926d9a3a1b0091459478c12acfde7baf03cd1","60ddc38bcefc33a0b2bbae3a5168b5f4c38b8be9","388f8fcb6456ca33ae3e861c06e8b978ba5914cd","f8bfe49b220e4122649231f34ebbef2620281c97","633b0ac498a15c56f3d301f4558dced3c1c87723","d580dfdb03ce9a16df0cf5dfe6a3f4b1a51ede9b","220661f416b7c2214fb010dc3a18589a7497059f","e1531c72052c009822f13590964715e1ef027e14","499bd93b942422a7c84701b51dd8141f7704bc05","7381835907bb01d91ae02876b69c87a0c8fa60a1","33d9da222a9de0e52021f42d5ad739d0ba061469"],"pdfUrls":["http://clweb.csa.iisc.ernet.in/shalinik/minthint.preprint.pdf","https://78462f86-a-4d284883-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/iisc-seal.net/www/publications/icse14.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coqBwmr-mS_WtQw9u_eq8BhbrYlZteAWlugWblHWKKLi69yamKfz9L_UpVJeJjiJIWvw6sOKMmBJBXMioSAFwu3kvh1zH-U7OJWF2Fr66nEEgFXj2Tmm56qpz4Skg-CjPxxleZQNyaC5K3Cgb3eY24Xo7KnoTE5SXC9EcUHxblckU3gY_fJwILXqGU2itjDciwFaQfcZgURfKyE4o7N9y_WsWnLxA%3D%3D&attredirects=1","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568258","http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1286","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1286v2.pdf"],"title":"MintHint: automated synthesis of repair hints","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568258","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568258","venue":"ICSE"}

By combining feature engineering and CBSE, legacy code can be modernized so that many organizations can benefit from this technique. In our approach, we identify the legacy system's features through test cases and test suites. We then apply our code carving techniques to identify the code associated with those features and extract the code to create components. We validate our results in two ways.

The premise of the field is that software development is an ongoing investment activity---in which developers and managers continually make investment decisions requiring the expenditure of valuable resources, such as time, talent, and money. The overriding aim of this activity is to maximize the value added subject to an equitable distribution among the participating stakeholders. The goal of the tutorial is to expose the audience to this line of thinking and introduce the tools pertinent to its pursuit. The tutorial is designed to be self-contained and will cover concepts from introductory to advanced. Both practitioners and researchers with an interest in the impact of value considerations in software decision-making will benefit from attending it.This tutorial is offered in conjunction with the Fourth International Workshop on Economics-Driven Software Engineering Research (EDSER-4).

That is, attackers clone the code from legitimate Android applications, assemble it with malicious code or advertisements, and publish these ``purpose-added\" app clones on the same or other markets for benefits. Three inherent and unique characteristics make app clones difficult to detect by existing techniques: a billion opcode problem caused by cross-market publishing, gap between code clones and app clones, and prevalent Type 2 and Type 3 clones. \n Existing techniques achieve either accuracy or scalability, but not both. To achieve both goals, we use a geometry characteristic, called centroid, of dependency graphs to measure the similarity between methods (code fragments) in two apps. Then we synthesize the method-level similarities and draw a Y/N conclusion on app (core functionality) cloning. The observed ``centroid effect\" and the inherent ``monotonicity\" property enable our approach to achieve both high accuracy and scalability. We implemented the app clone detection system and evaluated it on five whole Android markets (including 150,145 apps, 203 million methods and 26 billion opcodes). It takes less than one hour to perform cross-market app clone detection on the five markets after generating centroids only once.","inCitations":["61fc833e3cd86151ec5bb18dd083ae712a56accb","512020eba331a080e0f8cc14b4050a00dda5b4b8","f9de687d1d04171cb84937b4cdb4fa1a64070971","0223105ada32a3b7f8c29abc54b4e64932abc7d2","1f2297f36a46032f1ad0c97d43d12aeee328771c","a1e30a786c4cbfd9f3793ecf30998a81be4a7e7b","a0d5c4bf0778961dd2c2e9642bd4f62d83bd113f","9ae801d1446b387f0aaee221e491e9ddc5797540","971c566f33446adbf7e3e0ad578f3e717252c36a","3411f55c437f604749c0a6ea6465c4ed35c0541a","3172a5f9d1b541f0e80be7f148c8bc0bc6842f79","1d3ee39736299b9948b7d0264bac32ef4ef0c47e","3f147d5150aead1c38d386b7938ba8b8ee3d10e9","35f8e9b703b47c063c6d5fd8999804e1e815249c","d86129473ebc932af4cdcf143a196e60e24fad9b","3eba7dfa88f1b94d93531b634d85c1e2716293db","4124cca493c55059e08289219c65e9a1eb184520","9e27455c7d9886a556dab9a0cb9165cabc66b92f","0ec830d516363f1917056d699aab6f07af18a053","4a727288433c680afbfa12ac798d3c687b91501c","4e6d94ff3c0f4e0415ccc72faa1c15e1348e3396","54a7f1e19e21890d361acb16db0600f608f9459d","e57efd08b896adc90ec8abc4e12d82c63c17368e","576f99cea9f8127950c654471a674c13e7d8e1b2","a54e5957b5f27f15cfc4967a33f92decbff31e0b","377d767fe4bf529e3937fc6e8c46e6867e946265","be3f3abb6001cd8aaed95aa94f7f104a49c9621d","94f5c8cbfc4e7f6c5fb035fd7bab167a17794426","b34eb7aa9ee3c89b9d284a20904a8b4a8ef1524d","18ec9aa174db18f94c4bab972d8631b3fee26881","bcbbb19e0ea55be9232e9b327c05d59da4f795ce","211a8087ca9132b14816bb0c1cf52e34cc72f85f","11cb7f0e8c0d70e834ee5a1d756973ce34531cb1","870458836e98de6ced24f1757859307919f927c6","c974ca742f2dc083d933668a10a4bce0edc98b9a","786b1b6f5559bb028b7d46caa754b94929345c5a","624fcdf19c27cce2a76c8d102e24c65f8b2e3937","41e5c65d0a9794a5137085137d7a8dc13d4094ab","39e2e3d67eea8fdea16d0a66e1ffe45fd1b16700","249be713403b9cd762cc624276ca6fb23ce30407","2bcaccc59a49cd2856e982043576540a42340149","adbb5e233a4a9972621efa4e7c69fb29bab029ef","127935e6476c8b0c10daee9f94d904cd656b4b8c","ad8e80d2888770e75e9b07e02eea1155943d6aca","605d7b6721d46c8edbca63453d340a37f67c2ee5","69701afb6befc8e701b8e8ad852f11d088eb5fd5","19fbe8155ce3004e4979f6a97ec219456c6ed338","04f11ddd84b70531554ea9534aa601c6144b1533","834a7575d7817ca13bb090eb696e8c1100271907","54e1584e7da8e97a4f6e85fe6dcc4920ae323280","4e145225ce8918b36b311c08571e3839214b0604","12ae417253669b59c02bc407adee14193543e1f4","2b8f16094ab9b4fcda435c324b8b36b33c6e921c","2518295b96e355f7c68370611ff22228a6b3bc28","33f8f2e76d0190905c2bd3a2e611d28504fa4353","b9c56043a49f8ed0281deef6be2ed5c9c3717970","6819c75b28dc57c08d1c3bff387416d86987e6b3","5f2817c0bbd07614f6fffa91e9b679ae0f26f988","52feba25db65adc2821e2fbc1fe477155a6ff632","536b27c5bbecf1b3769c41b4817e77ab40684205","e02f59cf876cb40233573ff78a1609f969d301cc","522017f306d322e6496d6b1dcde1a26683c2f219","71859b24843eff6c84cb35948fb5c8e408d7f5f4","72a34e437f1ad1d063bff04c506fa4fc38de080a","99ec580ba98497739977d833f0b02d050d7b4e0c","a22c34f3e6ceaaca6cc0a641a1a38a83de96b061","d3fd6027797e2a3b318ce07f2f5f48616108c9f5","82836b41cdfbee34acd3b19432ad9e28abfe71ae","bbe8c5e53ca6e4db115afeaaad2be268f039f10d","4727dd478166d5ba48e9edb60ffdc24d55d48a1b","0d9eb69135653d7ed7b8ff8c4d30e4563cf68ed1","e21b39cad7daf62155b181e24c227c950f7494e2","d1e21ddbfce840af67fdca00d5702a86c5f553c8","b2db4f4dc7461354c60f8db3ef27afdc69354bea","3a244e78719496e3bc12c87ff0d1a60046002935","dfd0c5c437f574c46fee9287d4498f1d1a6be14e","1ada7bb097072381028f0a5c2606f7c766fde7c9","a5e66d639d3b8cfb6755ae958dc4476d5d8e6614","1da4cc57c936417d0da280bda25d0f1a088940cb","430b4c08b7cc4d34e62f947a6f99e10f2da0f57a","2e4c11deecca433c9848452c9b7837530db53941","1d6bac05aa955505eda27289327d21a6f1acdb03","dddf0091febec0bb849d06864bc9cfdb9d8ea74f","57832d0f683e2be40f556514973a43a119e50df3","9108d067899898281acdd5aeac19e39fa388d254","0d05023b2c14ba91035d8e6d1e6b0d64f54c15ed","56ca21e44120ee31dcc2c7fd963a3567a037ca6f","3b09d81e42da555eeb9620d533c844ff7a84b776","dcddbe6e0bb64d4792610d08bae06f6c11aec0c7","facf75b7e2a12a49e76c248e887cef887ffd78aa","9a725e4f0e7b8cbe8c4bde8356f5cce315c3292a","7647a0ef3bc423067753bea995117d4061f35771","07299ca3cfc38a92c00132127dd791ed6d4f681c","b20ed8fe63f66c25b6173efb6cf95c940b2c84a8","f70f37c4f3bfc4e9010a4bb36734927b06377ca8","11ba8322747a1460e64df0a91e8bbdab53310f37","d1306fbca238b3342ae922a6899fd3da65ba2479","130633f0653e6ad5766144299aa17938e7a5fca2","44d5011ae4bfa359c70a8e23b8e447dece69bbb1","53fe97b39dab788b11702881138c327aa8c90edc","c0b9fedc923ec9cde7e11c4512be1bdbdb563597","0bc9fa8b35bbeea04c9c400e0776f32917c981cb","aca599500909d09d931d6c1de803b19673589dfb","ed2d1daa777cdab882aee5c3efddd38520cf303c","747ce6b456cd26549d37d2ea1cfc9d9be64ed40d","5e491db0e11e71c6ed798052129712ef145b88bd","6bcbe895becdb670027a3e3c1e36ff7d63d3f7b4","8c5c728bb26c39f71272f4380f991e4446f781be","bccad316045861ef4ceb288f7dd9dff5cc2e5cc1","cb580b86ed801b9d8c2749a78d397c78f9697c09","12641d1d9b44e03baf9bfe4d52569acb4087bd7c"],"pdfUrls":["http://sites.psu.edu/kaichen/wp-content/uploads/sites/10220/2014/05/appclones.pdf","http://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/AndroidClones-camera-ready-final-ICSE2014.pdf","https://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/And

This approach suffers from the state-explosion problem, where the size of the model or the analysis costs may be exponentially large with respect to the size of the system. Using symbolic data structures to represent subsets of the state space has been shown to usually be an effective optimization approach for hardware verification. The value for software verification, however, is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate applying two symbolic data structures, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs), in two FSV tools, LTSA and FLAVERS. We describe an experiment showing that these two symbolic approaches can improve the performance of both FSV tools and are more efficient than two other algorithms that store the state space explicitly. Moreover, the ZDD-based approach often runs faster and can handle larger systems than the BDD-based approach.","inCitations":["7a49bf4bf9c9a63d362e783da5c5394d2f55b6aa","1c79cc227b4a4599d4a6182d00e2acd9f3082b83"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134308","http://ext.math.umass.edu/~avrunin/recent_pubs/zdd.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p152.pdf","http://laser.cs.umass.edu/techreports/05-66Rev.pdf","http://ext.math.umass.edu/~avrunin/papers/tan06-managing_space.pdf","http://laser.cs.umass.edu/techreports/05-66slides.pdf","http://laser.cs.umass.edu/techreports/05-66.pdf"],"title":"Managing space for finite-state verification","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134308","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134308","venue":"ICSE"}

Each year it becomes more and more complicated, just as the software itself. One of the aspects that negatively impact documentation quality is the presence of textual duplicates. Textual duplicates encountered in software documentation are inherently imprecise, i.e. in a single document the same information may be presented many times with different levels of detail and in various contexts. Documentation maintenance is an acute problem, and there is a strong demand for automation tools in this domain.\n In this study we present the Duplicate Finder Toolkit, a tool which assists an expert with duplicate maintenance-related tasks. Our tool can facilitate the maintenance process in a number of ways: 1) detection of both exact and near duplicates 2) duplicate visualization via heat maps 3) duplicate analysis - comparison of several duplicate instances, evaluation of their differences, exploration of duplicate context 4) duplicate manipulation and extraction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449485"],"title":"Duplicate finder toolkit","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195081","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195081","venue":"ICSE"}

In this paper, we describe an approach to enable the user to obtain a COTS glue code integration risk analysis with no inputs other than the set of glue code cost drivers the user submits to get a glue code integration effort estimate with the COnstructive COTS integration cost estimation (COCOTS) tool. The risk assessment approach is built on a knowledge base with 24 risk identification rules and a 3-level risk probability weighting scheme obtained from an expert Delphi analysis. Each risk rule is defined as one critical combination of two COCOTS cost drivers that may cause certain undesired outcome if they are both rated at their worst case ratings. The 3-level nonlinear risk weighting scheme represents the relative probability of risk occurring with respect to the individual cost driver ratings from the input. Further, to determine the relative risk impact, we use the productivity range of each cost driver in the risky combination to reflect the cost consequence of risk occurring. We also develop a prototype called COCOTS Risk Analyzer to automate our risk assessment method. The evaluation of our approach shows that it has done an effective job of estimating the relative risk levels of both small USC e-services and large industry COTS-based applications.","inCitations":["aff3b7430b82c6467e9d5b2580f6362153706d42","fe09975a70153712e423df8404d16ade225b7c1c","551fd9ce9adf766113e092ca2e6f31274b95801d","42b2e95408f235ca79e3fdf728ded5e5af23bb99","f6972934e8b6cb574a59db14f95393ad6f936e42","f6b326a999434b72d8a4140971d45468e856c5cf","f777a14a4fa27bc5d480661f0b7e3a9d1ff1d433","2563b7189b1cf5fb0cee8a7b005ba3d9e3bc5077"],"pdfUrls":["http://csse.usc.edu/TECHRPTS/2005/usccse2005-514/usccse2005-514.pdf","http://sunset.usc.edu/TECHRPTS/2005/usccse2005-514/usccse2005-514.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134345","http://csse.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/2006/usccsse2006-635/usccsse2006-635.pdf","http://sunset.usc.edu/events/2006/ARR/demonstrations/COCOTSRiskAnalyzer/COCOTSRiskAnalyzerPaper.pdf","http://sunset.usc.edu/publications/TECHRPTS/2005/usccse2005-514/usccse2005-514.pdf","http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/2005/usccse2005-514/usccse2005-514.pdf"],"title":"Assessing COTS integration risk using cost estimation inputs","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134345","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134345","venue":"ICSE"}

In this paper, an abstract model is developed to cover the significant aspects of a typical programming environment pertinent to configuration management, using a database to capture configuration knowledge. The two aspects of the model deal with configuration identification and configuration control. In considering configuration identification, it is shown that the tools in the programming environment determine which configuration items need to be identified and also determine what the interesting and useful relations are among those items. In considering configuration control, the notion of a workspace, consisting of certain modification rights and certain visibility into the database, is developed to prevent conflict and to promote cooperation among programmers. The entire model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of configuration management within a particular programming environment or as the basis of a programming environment design.","inCitations":["a9be0883516b391ef32ba71d8a730568f3259de1","350b898a89940e5718f074880151f74e1f395d53","b9f3b820cf9fdc53b9956e941bdfb007dbcc6d88","ee5e238e7efd1a76a974e4fdb1736fb7fcc635a2","5c6fff322fd89c6878d7a6d0cbfb4e53b008403a"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802516"],"title":"A Database Model for Effective Configuration Management in the Programming Environment","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

An excellent report [ 1 ] provides a brief review of several such methodologies as well as evaluative research and instructional issues related to agile methods and their potential impact. This panel provides two opposing views vis-hvis incorporating agile processes, and in particular eXtreme Programming, into software engineering education. The panel will be conducted slightly different from the traditional approaches. It will include normal paper presentations by the authors, followed by plenary debate. The first paper (authored by Lars Benedix, G/Sel Hedin, and Boris Magnusson) presents an experience from using eXtreme Programming to teach software engineering concepts in an undergraduate course with over 100 students. The authors' experience is very positive. The second paper (authored by Jean-Guy Schneider and Lorraine Johnston) conclude that introducing an agile process such as eXtreme Programming in software engineering education is not a straightforward task and the corresponding practices may run counter to educational goals. The paper presentations will serve as authors' position statements. Discussion and debate will follow.","inCitations":["3d91a7405ca1110774b2abd35877c25fd011cf13","60707ea4bd8cbd44c40739d9a81ccf95d5b18b60"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776920"],"title":"Panel: eXtreme Programming: Helpful or Harmful?","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The goal of the experiment was to investigate whether model checking could be used to find a subtle implementation error that was originally discovered and fixed during the standard formal review process. To conduct the experiment, a core slice of the DEOS scheduling kernel was first translated without abstraction from C++ into Promela (the input language for Spin). We constructed an abstract “test-driver” environment and carefully introduced several abstractions into the system to support verification. Several experiments were run to attempt to verify that the system implementation adhered to the critical time partitioning requirements. During these experiments, the known error was rediscovered in the time partitioning implementation. We believe this case study provides several insights into how to develop cost-effective methods and tools to support the software design and implementation review process.","inCitations":["006a8a2b6cb24e11fc296d594a020c0c44bb3dff","fcc2847feda4ce81db29701e192a9593c1c68e05","16e4c4d400797bb8cf356477df169b1c8935706e","26d5574f678603d81aafd1cd962adb748bfd1784","ecb1c40e9c77c617c15c290a41efe48609cc0cc8","12ce09939fea3d1bf391e7382e5dc73ba5504175","2a3802a444c94bc1f370a7d661a7681c905421cb","6a627f4feba6238559df037a140a066d4a8cea04","842872b0e7a192407b51d2c1f14d13860ea58b95","6735740e298c541e997c6badebe7ed6a6b0d8c83","035bb790ad0a9b53357cb3705a47acc6ed799acd","17c8540ddd670983517b5004975ba8699b48b37a","5b2b6b9399666d21cf8126505e50658c955dad45","06d912bcade3353232e3c4a6aa4256a70ad4bb5f","122df6d37f29dcccb2ce8287e19e0e341d3d0e59","8edd7639df2d9f3ba5218a7cac523f19d62f3e6c","3269ebe39bd26af7929ee7302e11e18b5fa4753f","5430ad6a24088c0642cb3f1674241e0e1afb789c","853f049d6a71a25c789e476467a31b12b5038ce6","8ec445c762139b7b28d9a55ca5b8e5977c323b37","3ab279eb2291c67813bd38d40145bb30e670039a","c0f763661498af440012306d7ea6050c1debe88b","1c3146ffbf4fa3e052ef6cfb6362ef4807b34d91","15d43037abf63c33a7827b7037b59b60b5dcc82a","6a41e6398bef1c43ef4facb27e9a239492ec3d23","9bd99c1e0da56ddff0ccc02ea53eb1e5116066a5","fab8cf6f7825cda18ccfa7c8bb5c947e77cf74ee","0c62eaa92a50cef5353c59603d918ebd0697dc13","1665a8e88e258e3af6874b4aa015a15fb4723238","c4b182143324319da10a3713802a7280ebbde34f","83b8f55dd089c72d245e11a4914b0d5422693cdf","6aa1a66e000a51da187c1ef36640172460349b11","9f9915a9902424aa6b625192af89c4873f44839a","f633337732ed97548a26392a235ed1fd02dd3c14","bf3c86745e7b67384231c866d369c2c101115631","49b2a27f70b44ad6e7e56735f7e232bb64809d17","5ba69c284ec20d544a7720a7d2a76853eece1cba","232d8831f9dff6695eeaf63694ed7ec7965f00b1","a92db24a45893dcee3dc2fa1c502a59d1843a30f","2a40c5d2d0e49737481c22b0847fd493f7607585","8da8416eb05772ca7e88e5b44b9aaacb891484ce","9026b095c40b9f89e7a628008240d4096a8f1031","130f6a61b975910679f62005e26fa947802cbcc7","9225a3a9c8a0e57d596038fbe13fcd074a8a39d8","156011c5f03ff8da609fe5676b14991e48228037","b7101483b1db715e50a2f72f409af26c52040693","2e4e85c3d9c292687ce776beab83b6898db76f47","b8157c17532346197f691a73e719872bcd7e8a09","26dfab6f330a410e2b3512fb7f8f76ebeda9762c","07a5fbf3d5882d183e6d5658e0ce186a2e85dac6","0e1e95519b8a3a581fbc3d9311962b1a131bcade","1b3f16c4c1ba4300aa603d6d488c8323828ad226","f8474188e8f5e750785fe6cae12997241df5cdc8","709fe028c32603ed2b7ed114fd7ff540c1143f15","bc53d848749d08b8fb07fb55cb3a16e84d79a928","71af2f6bdbcd267d99b367ff5d302b68e33ed7a3","308683d1a53a3fd6b0905c9e76dda1c0ee2ffed2","4f55746609d601598af4f9fa6dd2b81d0f388a74"],"pdfUrls":["https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","http://www.riacs.edu/research/detail/ase/deos.ps.gz","http://www.ic.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub/archive/0213.pdf","http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/publications/pdf/2000-0213.pdf","http://www.ic.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/archive/0213.pdf","http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/archive/0213.pdf","http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub/213h/0213%20(Penix).pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337364"],"title":"Verification of time partitioning in the DEOS scheduler kernel","doi":"10.1145/337180.337364","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337364","venue":"ICSE"}

However, this abstraction does not come for free: understanding how to use an API can be difficult. While API documentation can help, it is often insufficient on its own. Online sites like Stack Overflow and Github Gists have grown to fill the gap between traditional API documentation and more example-based resources. Unfortunately, these two important classes of documentation are independent. \n In this paper we describe an iterative, deductive method of linking source code examples to API documentation. We also present an implementation of this method, called Baker, that is highly precise (0.97) and supports both Java and JavaScript. Baker can be used to enhance traditional API documentation with up-to-date source code examples; it can also be used to incorporate links to the API documentation into the code snippets that use the API.","inCitations":["2b73dedea1e2dfbc6e2e0d7390ccbe3d91a11a8a","483d592c1c5ace8bc0b6d7cb2b30d949ef6af258","329947aa599c968941ffc17a3f0df9f632ab9a62","1c159db22f8a6e7c177d9c9fdb5c3972514a12f9","1d9c253f030506af6abf24efe89496ebe621eeac","5dce4b8f233d625335f8eeaa1092fd3d6a34dff4","1c9a5c58b6fabe16ea9a85dbf75fc7ae8b9c6772","178a226a4fa68d80f709d0cfff5f5458df0daad3","66ecaa50b4bac845640f65d4a8e1f0829bf8537b","22eb2fbbc2d456bf9005ee55628628bc22d92dae","15ae09715e2b3f10d41a08a98509176efeddcb37","29ce4bcf66a044b56a5182891d76d1bdee0640ff","4334ea9a348efd1c02ad97beb1af2d97e4b01ca7","65a139d7f368bafdb043fb4ddc0c499b611361fd","42a1e825677323feb16013277bfaa1722439f938","cc92648fec76b6d9be11e7a89e4e7126e1802426","4b8cec28093e953af12528fe22b2ce739d9c5eff","24bec313e30feb948730faf6e395709adeaa24e2","078e34f1bf43f60fc311cb2bcd7cfcafcf53c229","3899381352ff94ef806ec6d9cec0d4fb3c0325bc","7d0162b5448c229ea9216714560b3397a5477544","36297b5a4b06f1722bf130b2c0d2720ec020ab9c","2bcaccc59a49cd2856e982043576540a42340149","eb563405e8c281b4756168deeb2d857dbb7af7aa","38c16bc344370d9e6f353f275b9a0e10b2012adb","2a599ea833fa095005542aba6456877f3ccc4f58","69c9c615230ff1c0dd4561ac937bcdbb1468c64e","bec4a48551ce5b3a434c758bea38d488693da153","f667a15a6dd1db99e4d2728701045536815fc953","f5f6d68405e95540685d17eed9b0e86b36eadf8d","c920a6353df1cfe003bb880e51bfe41104736ded","a3ba139b97bfa0cd4801ff6ddc5a13673f5a58a8","f1465e05c3dca96887c32d8b8a9aea346e419da1","b62ed7de30c4709d1ab39a812d7c71dcb312a682","c62de0c59ce2f9d6c8d37edab0fb1ea743e58970","240b5789bdfda297c1a67c4e2ff46eb3084acb67","7e95d7e3bcdb4dfb63a6174e6bcd29345d3715b8","07112c549df6a3280521d551a3cc153d284849d0","f6efd648c2ebee9eb7d112cf679184038d92baeb","d766d9d4d7f3ebbf9acb364575ba18d2b7709b7d","f56e5db9fd14651922cb66b878455bf063eef12a","e4f10bd4d0ea0e10af728c5847e226f9e60a775e","32b5667da238af7e01a6715dbb160db5848a0601","225381c77fa766789973549bf67d24ad53aca00b","b2aff786f0b5e92940d95e274fb348254ba044b5","a73bd1dff0c3718d438d56c19239ddfd2e8149e9","3d6d451add6897eef6cf0a183b9ff46d3a33b5d3","39fdd9a51ec67f3a178ffb30df06abf4cdcf31e2","eea9224429795ba1dc365afe62841429c827eadc","b6dbf5bf562c2f1fa45e31a4e756682b8b38a211","20d9fe8bf0f7762be566bf49e1921731ee260495","7724e05ca8610e338f0a4f2c0fadadf193f8196e","7f7fabbcd2a92ef4382bc436defb88a07f9f7145","47e719d527cf720ace2cbd2d9e89f8d37b428335","2c2e6e95d15f09dae7d2eb13d0e65a79583fe4c7","612ec8d4d8a4630c4823b6b6bbab0fd283b13125","ae597e825cef267781c1b29b6ef5cc0a8a7817a9","2e6ba8c692e5ec57fc7d81747cad7da6cca1233d","875602eb78c9c91fa9e6c470b2948b105e47c912","994b8dbfa12027ed24285a1e34c20cae8831173c","35bb635c93aa34771ca79d2d6b68d3fa0cd40351","972860c3256cd1dab323f1ed07e8d3af35051ac1","49343d751e436314e83326fa9e0d02fe33c986be","a536baaca7357069b6779b210be65e58d9494cb7","65a6ad3ded805f8669d22ca362886b9ef5e27060","29afdb3f12701cf1904c734a4c0947a59318dfa7","40debe77b8be8f6c5f3ecba29754e64873f6a963","584abc89bdf4f434feafc0736607a45d9f56df2b","43cc23e78a99d1cb2ab632705f643dc00a805ece","95e44b39fc9821ace9182f74d68c45d3ece44aac","eb310dbab25525c959c7d942643c0063607719d9","c9e28cfcaa3875ebc89221016c75a9cb87f6acff","771821636c87f9b338e20c35674116e1b99bade6","36582753b7f89fe657b09ffab7b54d4e156e823f","61f16e7e701e160da382da24aa3c6434cad419cb","9f1ec3594a4d534e9e86c9d9680d2c50647b5c43","d1db92d598394908bc6f7e4b036bb940de6445dc","305b2f9ddcdc5ca4ce668d642893ded4b67aaa4d","3041a9265afb2ebdb4915aa9572668bb7f32b0ef","1b92342312662a52a155a23887f0e7e43fe5511c","7786ce04f6a6bac45b89251b4eaf0e40fabfbd84","e3130200db40fad9afcba60ef0525ed8ab88d1a9","b5546d04e0da089fc6ad013ceb453657c12ecadf","1e46afc7528d9ce8e3864f0e2e99235fa78b43ce","764875b4788f486d2222d0f36a73304ed1bd7c88","00ece373a91f2c7a84d5762a2da8774a64269b7d","aef77ed17e86eb4610d6f87d72b30161b534a43e","68efca981e9ebb2dc448845dc6bc0f6f82cd9769","28f5dbf8e370dacdf3b8a439e92b35bb5815fd80","38cf0ad67422f39937bc6465bca755115d67b412"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rtholmes/baker/2014-ICSE_talk.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rtholmes/papers/icse_2014_subramanian.pdf","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/papers/icse_2014_subramanian.pdf","https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/8579/Subramanian_Siddharth.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/sites/ca.computer-science/files/uploads/files/cs-2013-17.pdf","https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/sites/ca.computer-science/files/uploads/files/CS-2013-17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568313"],"title":"Live API documentation","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568313","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568313","venue":"ICSE"}

Symbolic model checking explores many states simultaneously and reports numerous erroneous traces. Automated assume-guarantee reasoning, on the other hand, infers contextual assumptions by inspecting spurious erroneous traces. One would expect that their integration could further improve the capacity of model checking. Yet examining numerous erroneous traces to deduce contextual assumptions can be very time-consuming. The integration of symbolic model checking and assume-guarantee reasoning is thus far from clear. In this paper, we present a progressive witness analysis algorithm for automated assume-guarantee reasoning to exploit a multitude of traces from BDD-based symbolic model checkers. Our technique successfully integrates symbolic model checking with automated assume-guarantee reasoning by directly inferring BDD's as implicit assumptions. It outperforms monolithic symbolic model checking in four benchmark problems and an industrial case study in experiments.","inCitations":["127cba13c903b4a5efdd33c8e8335cc215478fe4","7ed2b213c17c269ef993effa9e2639c7de6c19e6","1e3dbcd9c09666c092100abd254572371ce3130d","6f8d917ede992b23214fe17515193cf7904161b2","5fb921455141d02786141df464c1765d3eaf3687","1a49c77944a0b29dbe4f0817b0625ff97fc030b6"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~bywang/papers/icse14.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568253"],"title":"Symbolic assume-guarantee reasoning through BDD learning","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568253","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568253","venue":"ICSE"}

Early prototypes help to decide upon the most effective architecture for a given situation. Questions to answer include the boundaries of components, communication topologies and of replication. It is desirable to evaluate and compare architectures for functionality and quality attributes before implementing or changing the whole system. Often, the effort required is prohibitive. In this paper we present an approach to efficiently create prototypes for service-oriented architectures using aspect-oriented programming techniques. We explain a procedure for transforming interaction based software specifications into AspectJ programs. We show how to map the same set of interaction scenarios to different candidate architectures. This significantly reduces the effort required to explore architectural alternatives. We explain and evaluate our approach using the Center TRACON Automation System as a running example.","inCitations":["48d4ba80fd62d33f9cf23247603c9502e6354b73","777543c2372fa2f122b0da04dd65981e6358eb6c","48f63c5b82e975458aba2ed51bc71b44827a0a66","ab75f597e895a52c7be4be2351b66446a245022e","af3f95469192de9db02eccbdaf014f5386c9ac5a","dda85858a3c9744e28ad830a413bf629b5014eb3","849034d595872c0802a215718fb8aff160094396","5e25892e1ca73f071e21f185d127a8d531796011","44219d649befa6338dd21ce5ba01824001964b75","f4711625a1484944ae2baa098624ff4f00ef0c33","2486d8f3e8f5b88663bbf1c61d7200f121566c89","75c50422c1f51745ab85e44a51701936bbac96bc","7d926913a3193fcf2acdffcfee47fd4a88fbfd50","e56b2b4fd8b73a94c289254b13086699aec96e38","726a9e7837a67350e6af7fbef9869d81a7d3431c","e8f4c69b8e3d304bc9f394607346ab3b02ccf57f","2aeba09515c82ec993c1d1ff1e6c4283c1b7cd70","820faf600045ebeced92b4c254c0a53ea07aa934","44ea5d0b1ac7dc158e9a7955385e68a3fa14890b","ebbf67a173d68f39a29d87b5a2a3ff13d1aa7d25","38c08fb8ff2d212ce000e81ba435685fcc1eb09a","b84f8d5f9730a127c2c6c8b32a5e6893ffb0819e","65cd24057dabe7862871690271a97d816732b3a5","ffe00011f739e64412e880be1d6e155f3791cc66","f712b32d52b1033998c4e520633b9d238eb7d254","a87bcd40f5fbdb8c09e70e4f95043ba261669782","389ba3e3a7c5d1421871a30a4e9f0fea96aa3096","8b204a87a8a9c6bbf8f028ebcefebfb79c55871b","8fc0f65d466fe24dd188788e5de22fcaf8a13f83"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~yfcai/CS575/Lectures/papers/res118-krueger.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p62.pdf","http://www4.in.tum.de/publ/papers/kmm06icse.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134296","http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS865/Papers/p62-krueger.pdf","http://wwwbroy.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/publ/papers/kmm06icse.pdf","http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/publ/papers/kmm06icse.pdf","http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~djanzen/courses/509W08/readings/SOAAspects.pdf"],"title":"Efficient exploration of service-oriented architectures using aspects","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134296","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134296","venue":"ICSE"}

Specific evaluation criteria were developed to judge the effectiveness of the methodology, its support tools and user training. The approach included attending a SREM training course and using SREM to specify the software requirements for two Air Force systems. The relatively small number of errors uncovered indicates the effectiveness of disciplined requirements analysis techniques and the capabilities of SREM for exposing subtle problems.\n In general, it was found that the SREM was an effective vehicle for specifying and analyzing the software requirements of large embedded computer systems, especially descriptions of real world objects, data requirements and message processing. However, deficiencies were noted in the specification language, in the “friendlinéss” of the user interfaces to the analysis and simulation tools, in the performance of these tools and in the effectiveness of the training. Appropriate improvements to all of the functional deficiencies are recommended.","inCitations":["0770286afdedafbf096852f1e8d340945ef2e5d0"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801967"],"title":"A Large System Evaluation of SREM","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Nevertheless, the adoption of a domain-specific language is hindered by the difficulty of transitioning to different language syntax and employing a separate translator in the software build process. We present a methodology that simplifies the development and deployment of small language extensions, in the context of Java. The main language design principle is that of language extension through unobtrusive annotations. The main language implementation idea is to express the language as a generator of customized AspectJ aspects, using our Meta-AspectJ tool. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the tool integrates into an existing software application much as a regular API or library, instead of as a language extension. This means that the programmer can remove the language extension at any point and choose to implement the required functionality by hand without needing to rewrite the client code. Second, a mature language implementation is easy to achieve with little effort since AspectJ takes care of the low-level issues of interfacing with the base Java language.","inCitations":["709b33b4ff9ec704abe8171402d4d225e16c9673","1ea441d2386f9ab631645a4e1c5b7334d086499c","84b4ee67f5ea96ab84bfda7abb991d6797574ddf","5da44e33b141817c8529458fdae76992297467eb","1d62e321bd1b2652d6c76eb8b15a30746283505c","07d542ed01fb001b5b158846b3be8526ca6b9556","05f22ae0aa6515b4be557b62e10aaa8f22133005","ae76a72b44861ae1f43a4085877fceef40eb3265","4fac0173219127937662444fefccfed772d1e910","0f803ae5c5ad42ad67a1c74eff507c5f265e60f5","9730495f05ee832afea0f8e032933ccca0dacceb","16458dae50bc19595e961eea63fcf38d49b302e9","a8f444ca18da0f426f1fbe98ba9d1b61af0ff4cc","558d179a0289567c944e8b11ea0d11eed8162de2","17240e77755f5bf9bd3942fd7344774dcaf7c6fb","1d78f312918f2b72bffba94ed5bde926de7ac30a"],"pdfUrls":["http://yanniss.github.io/maj/maj-app05.pdf","http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/~yannis/maj-icse06-er.pdf","https://yanniss.github.io/maj-icse06-er.pdf","http://www.freeflygeek.com/docs/ssh-icse06.pdf","http://www.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/maj-icse06-er.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p865.pdf","http://people.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/maj-icse06-er.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134436","http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/maj-icse06-er.pdf","http://www.cc.gatech.edu/maj/maj-app05.pdf"],"title":"Easy language extension with meta-aspectJ","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134436","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134436","venue":"ICSE"}

patterns.","inCitations":["8a6d38b9103bb2526fa41a7a58b529ac0db1ed34","2b09f5a3cd6c8a79143f22eefeaa3266d743f8ff","d24bc60c2bb5c0f0d51312538bcf20bb7b262e70","18d891eeaabed44a44223989cdb83978f5075a02","81f3537221e3c033d215fb4205aa3203d1ce6045","113f5fc6b0d909a6243d796cf9c03202949771b3","4ac725657c76d69a0915222cfbb74341af21d128","e0f8b3db54651099005bf1debdd1da8047953e98","74f70c3b7c8cbd37193143087bdcc04ae8df2311","1501178f2ef19922d6f95de087ee39d890c40b47","075f8503878bb9ceaa243e7872f9840b1388922c","f9cc303ed9addf63730d37e78e6169f750015468","e0ac4770249bf51b5bf30f73288d52c11dd1049c","d44c4944f5159e998711e79138b5522f5f6cfff4","61e24f7fae5182d2eef2b69d364d83a746ae279e","98d9d6d9aab872551d9182cd21c93c2bd4f495d6","de35b6597e16869062d9e2679cab97d4b32d44c8","51948240e4191179ce76a6dab4a6a28e36e18aa4","34b4f8b7b5225ba82f8170abaffe7590f1c04e17","6905b3f88f09382510648b16822616332269daa3","daa424ad426e3a178fb8f7d190b4170855c35fbd","aff0a90d564bc33a6fc1bfb16bfae12655efd28c","a851b38c914b5c005e2be8b43c2d17c98e09f7c1","45674ab89637524d50f4fd232c9c4983a91c9968","8d7472db348f5151bc2318a16bbb46d0aa54e2e1","f011ef84faaa00e00a8ae408c87e9a3d78346700","c920a6353df1cfe003bb880e51bfe41104736ded","1085533cbdd2bd2990719d2cccb8f40f5b2ba556","193d1415469cde989eafb01a1d4e8ba98dc03e0f","c38586fc1d7795be341a36623f6541e594cc473d","258d04671ca93b2bcc515cd2436760c54d164470","f862bdbc7ceeadeae257f462ef9d394d994c2c03","66ecaa50b4bac845640f65d4a8e1f0829bf8537b","39857322482ed87f52d53a40475c631d72693ccc","0a6c4993df90140b74a66ac1e3d5c73b410fcb28","4606114f19059feea37c3192f256d47fc309be52","a1b761a3c3ae67c0eb3103ab15c202919d179d49","04e92f9d20a8d47eb90fe5b79511174a9551dcdb","297ac4306022c4bda3a20a656accf1a73563ef86","665954c53b57e2a808d2d67f0cbfc5442da198d0","6f4849f56eae80cff30761b64ccb935c389c09c4","9c436de2712a0a8a09f1a1d0fdf31b1a09359ab3","3b2f3740c3d9c2d05e99eddef2569d5b50e298fb","c572c43e29777378426ef76b80c49768037c7247","29e111bca994aeb6193b960c060bdc40b9e4907b","954f901d031158ba85385ca69d39918896e922c9","0bae04f86b5302345d18b99801829efc98c90874","6bc94632c5f678abf3229fd38e0b819cf1853cb5","8425416e750c73839b16f673d7dbbcfabd888dd2","84888322883e8b7a63bc61568c1655f3966f3a12","90dd4d856a8b841fcd5b082d785c8dbe9072dfed","2881345b78c95f9c600b899ad2c15a1dff742893","1e2d469c6df82526d1c6d2eca5de95b8525e1c41","a88255e9f3b9500194b9e699bec08730aa3ae732","b245342cf6b1d06e2d080ca20ac0cfa9870f0970","d5d14bc786c8bc508d381d10e024c5ecbb085032","4cc4dba733af5490151b31e57985f8a3ad1c2097","048c6deac1c35d29dfdf2b75b15980c533f156e6","33c19ae3c785d161651b012173a26c399fa12078","3efc4f4389b551aecc06738550d16f11f53f21fb","139d3cd0493c861530404307cb5c508067d2e0dc","971c566f33446adbf7e3e0ad578f3e717252c36a","89fae4cefaefddcf61bb1f074bf2cddc38ca1f49","2b0df36c661362c8e6bddd71e331d2203fc97cf1","c9aa1e069796cbab2dcb75fb312e3747ebbccf5f","254bfed6030c95da1824cb8337543d487acbb5be","3e82fdb8e7bca236bf560d6d3d0f40b227225c72","305b2f9ddcdc5ca4ce668d642893ded4b67aaa4d","46274a970eaaeaa1164114df607664c2b227ab5d","803c71fb7f234f3772aac69337e6f29d56247311","172badb8d6ce5331b9208821d0b79523bca8d2ba","39861b52b52cc2a7f9e574560052f39197e51111","b20ed8fe63f66c25b6173efb6cf95c940b2c84a8","653ab2ac79fbcb64a1037a9ea9e936d35d20f19e","f328b2458b09c58d08a966d91b7a56f1beb50524","80caa8b3e3d5d4d7e20f9ec3ab0f597533fb5800","3c2fc4e7e61c4e3f66a96b926bbecee946c46059","b73694c24ec259da39e125c2c7d9496b2f222ba0","aee7495fd674fe6665813b540134d2d8a2584f0d","42ce0afbe27913f3da97d4d08730b2fcaf15e18d","59e27eaa8e7123c74be2e742fec4d0d106f83171","cea13d6d4cd2b30ffd87f7806f86bbdf41fa1ac8","d89696cbc325e883f484b8d76e513bfe52aa692e","324a4546cde50244c7b7f06eb00c7babafc3ac9d","c0356e43c92a29a31f5eaace1c4c50fb10e0f553","12bda2e03c17054ee958c9c109cddc26826845e0","5c308003ed2be30ed6b616a2a477970c5dd126c0","0db4f8a69cb2644d5eee542e14cd607e0c484f4e","3fb416be9e59b35c7cc91cd11b5b3f3f5491f13a","0e528eb8167c68930c2e1ab20ab5c14f98446927","881730a0ac579d41f587a17550a5487a32b49cf2","a56b618d860911ce28c02fb75868d295fc1a9809","361d0121f49d526602ddd9bf369a4bc402e5e0fb","84db326990741d3c6a8514d9767ee645aa3ccf8b","05a5702d7853499236b50258e26fa36a3b4c9c98","27b0502c6e1dda5264600e09696b2082ed3f60a1","c3a820bd47428eb87a12a4d9c5102ce9a5d1406b","57afa9dfe222a5c891393efa0d733d23aa365c7e","0339584e6c0b073e2f62383a7a76d448766143f1","aca599500909d09d931d6c1de803b19673589dfb","e687a28b4c7edea5ef4544adcd1887cea043c27c","b9455a09fb4efc302f7e2e7a1d97db64cc80fc8b","069409952202bd3d77591a7ffbc52b4dec14ed72","dd2066a592921143fae8b5002cdf427bcf08473d","34e8e4dbde847f30691abc124eb967b706dc8980","d92f4e502d1d444c871dc4418513cb3d40d0637e","5a3dac7a91d4babc1be0916e8bad840dec5e8619","9cbf0e02aba3d145873d4d65789bac4754b839da","57832d0f683e2be40f556514973a43a119e50df3","714f155f213a6350ed72c3f0076f25494ee6b93e","1bee62e1faacc87a97b49a9b241cf81eed5d0b73","7ee244fb83e2ea67d2125246e53d0656d39200d0","ffe5cdb5b26486b009e98adbf4dfc00a8ff2a5d2","9985263282b833410ab9d3bf8632077f0e33dd0a","634332fdea619164bc29ac4c401b91808be46732","38abd509c14fd7acaa2b01f56d51

A variety of techniques have been proposed in the last year for the design of self-adaptive applications; however, most of them is tailored to specific applications or can provide limited guarantees of effectiveness and dependability.\n Control theory has, on the other hand, developed a wide set of mathematically grounded methods for many engineering domains that interact with the physical world. However, applying these methods to software systems is not straightforward. Software is rarely designed to be controllable and its behavior is hard to model in formalisms amenable to control.\n In this technical briefing we will recall a set of foundational concepts of control theory, explain how they can be transposed in the software engineering domain, and discuss some insights into the design of controllable software.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2889160.2891058"],"title":"Control theory for software engineering: technical briefing","doi":"10.1145/2889160.2891058","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2889160.2891058","venue":"ICSE"}

The approach proposed by Jones and Kelly (extended by Ruwase and Lam) is the only one we know of that does not require significant manual changes to programs, but it has extremely high overheads of 5x-6x and 11x-12x in the two versions. In this paper, we describe a collection of techniques that dramatically reduce the overhead of this approach, by exploiting a fine-grain partitioning of memory called Automatic Pool Allocation. Together, these techniques bring the average overhead checks down to only 12% for a set of benchmarks (but 69% for one case). We show that the memory partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead. We also show that our technique successfully detects all buffer overrun violations in a test suite modeling reported violations in some important real-world programs.","inCitations":["0719b9670c8580db76547497df39caabdc20fc32","a5ab9d46f3f3c01dce0d4bc1b5285306cd6e563d","cacc69d0ed9db37f9b1ce9675b3d636e4255c72a","3df4834a33d06f300eaa357974be1f5780cee27c","be60cd79a3b9d48ba1de71d4fc5df3edfc68a646","1591e9cf9c5d5fa42e7b5e48bd76f43a0a6e8f0b","d988e247c13edf67429a3c823172e2c2b7e30e00","02bc67e573d1b201eb902467d9f459cc65290794","62c3921de0ee890107672a325311ebdbeaaf67a8","1efd1c72bea50ec420f4fad17567b44aa38cea69","a554ff7b552d7adb23b8762b2cddbfb4450e76d9","639dff839d687bed11935f6c06a47c938d4c3542","85ab60ec8776b8a30af47d09e22d0375151071c7","49c155543aa264bf90eb88c82acce9f8735921d7","029e930160bb7fcdab920e68526a79b1960ad89c","80789398d0ecd371daee78d46e2bc4bf97b73b47","7c2ef013f6275746108f74bd1f6321093f1fb2e6","b904dc8addc0201c8d0d4d3ed81b6b41d3275380","8ec257a9f506c2c32e90a3135a6cadb119e45d0f","a81574187ac46d709ec9429b9988a0bccf386492","8d74c8b87fef5f049e6d2673684a2543b050bf33","e3b95e60d21335c98903b17641c072e545218bf2","12e2db1e82a84cff97e8dbf11619d135b340b49c","c4e77ec0e6e4ac6638b662bfe5342439ad4451de","8a9c09c52f6821cbbc054923293293e125099463","f36f6ba0891c96a18bb597218a9d781db39b98cc","219eb813b257a30802b07990ac12019fe58479ca","d32be16ef74d22d3b9cf5d9854d944f521da0627","07d19fd0d2080d843db0208d7556ace8b6e9d5c2","9e235446d2c4fe77b56b4e0bfd1a645421d95f76","73977805fe1f8b9da40df3a1f2357f0a5fe4e7e0","5f8bbc28027342b16df77fa1b9a1efe4628d41dc","20083a475bda69032e69372569ada9d9ad9d6e4b","f31839b28a55ae40a970ee4fa2b9b6fa26ed697f","a57c2ba6c9e6f34b62842e70c1842cc33190ef07","5bc089924d1bdb719751a07168f5b5ab4b9f5dd8","8dc1faa00f245b349dbac8a989030b3af2411ba6","c0f439a3af32b7af3f826b278f32b4ef497e864a","e7766caedb7a13d14aa6aba4f4ce0073961f622f","c6a1a581757e84b7436ed3d105382fb9dba6ce19","a56d51b257d9ee37c99d487d0d3aa72f0402ec49","8f09a1fc7cc3db56ebdb87a96991715c3dace757","b2fb996bb0daaf8609e72c751140da95d080fb62","aef591699d29e58a8f99b56bdb3fdab25baf3bfd","11eef614e088a5329d120d40ee006861391bc2d9","375a67afe320e978b779b4749ee6b349190c23f6","27884b4aa969eb2d0591ac6bd2c193a5527b6ce2","a6962613fdfb033ab9da64fed376b61915656e61","9400beb3612ecda9bc20301ad58082ab31974026","25a8afdfae0d607fa991e84c20f21646bd779fe3","b8ef42e3b62276c9a482c48062637610da20307e","6196e171b0a0eee364f7ba782ec57cc210a27a66","501c9e97c85130833be0fad8bac9072d9623c7d8","32a6b8f747d7d90e6f1e19c3702e9ad13dc5904f","6a9744ec5ea1659d90f3dab0d6ce40f628432d1c","8dae69288c7e18d9b9db169826abe4ad676b7059","4f0655f1dfba053b70fbe33c4c78f2c2bea06cbf","76f3732a112c37bf251fd6338d760c2cc3b07c66","871a59fcbcc3f69d08c9fd0911c24cac53005329","84eb78775dc84c4794b54ed13fcd2b3bcb6490cf","0152d7554b3bd8372266e5ceddd0e2bf0ead6c11","e5e0ae77487cea8272caa939608b7b4119b2b94e","49cae25a1796b6a2898b99b2684b33eed8f58ee9","587671dcc5e2c3460c2efda21c3c468efe8544e0","996079c235a354232127a80a99e0a8e35c7394b3","933dce04cfe0f8e21c5b3d3eaf4595891e695b4f","0c69db05df0a2c876b4ddcf292b1334f1dc0378f","ea6ce82e4a25962b0e33df2104f0fb4dcd5b2189","41c050f5965d6cca4f670d724173e69978052581","aceb7c42be3406f50e837952e6bb6673feeb0e5e","887d76cb0c6e0e65c4763433bed84ba5e8a6f209","159da61cd43e5276908858953f18aa623e3019e1","b580c1d6ce75de73ecb280df412bdafafc4841d1","ca2e8a61cc90b402c1fe92a6d0bd86ccf31f0642","e33e0a7178a3c051c7c72fa109123b41cb135715","5e7d19d64c509efd6e478ffeef144efec0de9416","6a89f9cb74c32958f70a06ea9b27dc9c69e42ccf","6812c1bd3d52f2f7f2df7fb8e8b3ee14cd874e0a","56a85ee06ff46dfdea62f695130f7423de0a3168","fe0ab8562575c9f64c2b621fced612795d45b8cb","e86ddd8d8e1544769ab05013cd03766d102df26f","43dddff3d89a936107c267176e32f30e092e084e","8be4d81a0cd754aa418703f2eccb2641344b877e","0f4855901a89813cf39104293f086214200e5421","3d6395a04f7436b143339bbb7e4e46dfaaaf8afb","a995d31a1d1d0d51b3c8445733f897d45f9f349b","c7338930f1cedc93d8079522c7293297f16f6578","de56c3f41c59c26c71a76dff3f5e52cfaca989ee","f58a5fc215df626f6f5f7951f5a0f4ec04d3a40d","d9114a5f38d28624ddfcdf7ca7b855b222cc9802","1810f70bdcb6f50ff70bed2c165918046e6a8aef","71b5e96c643c31a3e2efd90e932ce2fa176a65e7","0e60fd3fd5cd9d5ad33845c4610594311981c9ac","df2213faf04faceb26dfbd95c8480a372295e27d","8267cc512d360f5859bec8d149bb4d017fa8519c","84c4310019cc0d0544e979c690782b36b82cf912","48577d4348ce1f2851dbb70a0f72e940b7a96fac","52612064aa065b29930b56fbf54745883bba94dc","65192f3d0ffb066a4c47a09fc11fdfad47dd192e","3b8aaf9dca0f43c6ab15308b23ea6d7e6c857618","0e18225921195751d04365d62e9ee30922d1efc0","4b49f5fcd805a39fff768d874db0b7454994aaae","e5e1c284e2ca2337bc34c4c6fa13820e5957e10c","0499e313a449605edc1213ca3b538b1fdebbc396","d3d6903e665bf2f136ab82219776c19610f49be4","0d4843d31be7198a94a68b00488148d4fa693567","480d4a756381f7aec1ffda84a3d7f1ef2695252a","fa6e792ddded8de1e77040faf2b9818e6fad6ad8","4220dad5850abe8c6051cc80686fd8727d5d64a0","079460eeab2b9d3d9b390a3b432c6a7e734b1e62","182de399067d1aab948f426dfbee87ff5e9a50de","196d341cdfb85f1a1d2e431fc40f34604c30bb59","d84bd06a0ea53df7316e9cdbee705093a01bcf3e","0988a425689f6f3700e797f4a2c18f73692573c3","0cd07d56483003d50f4af8df95f524af94bc8c2a","3fc465bd00bb246d890a5bbdf695

This is considered a prerequisite to effective “provisioning” of new and improved methods and tools.\nTaken as a whole, the paper should be useful to software developers, tool providers and major software buyers alike. Through typical environment evolution scenarios and concrete examples, many useful suggestions are provided to each of these players on how they can assist in the software engineering improvement process.","inCitations":["17044a8cdcafb916557a93733e7758765fba63bd"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=319653"],"title":"Software Engineering Provisioning Process","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Agents are units of software that can deal with environmental changes and the various requirements of open networks through features such as autonomy, mobility, intelligence, cooperation, and reactivity. However, since the usual development method of the agent systems is not sufficiently investigated, the technology is not yet widespread. This paper proposes a method of agent system development based on agent patterns that represent typical and recurring structures and behaviors of agents. The agent patterns are classified according to their appropriate architectural levels and the degree to which they depend on specific agent platforms. Our method enables developers to design agent systems efficiently since‘ they can construct complicated system architectures and behaviors by dividing the design process into two architectural levels and applying the appropriate agent patterns. In addition, the higher level designs are independent of specific agent platforms and can be therefore easily reused.","inCitations":["6bbc2769ba9d62d115b493ce99329c76658194cc","90d8fe4be2ff8fae8739e693eeb30e53896ca87f","1ac36f62c60099dad4ae206970603178e77f0fb4","0f301d9bf3623146b8717535e211c0a4a9bf6493","3805db5fb442ed3c9fc5ae5155203ee28dc0285f","6538cd44e7b46cbcc94d4d17040b08f77bd11ae2","610f9d86466acc89b2d733d98ed38f0f229e6988","a0bc9f94f5a126b2641b309319453e4ec7d153c8","16402f0cf824058437e6a95bbc4638fc2902bac7","a2cd3412d2fbe1fdd11c960e64b37796692274dd","72d24780f6694d8c91570a99b81150c951fcdd27","412fc23fc5702fec9c24cc4a6fdf250a3fdca715","89f756a98ba985055a8daa99d7ccfaf7f989ec78","cf0a91f591e44baf57a099be5149ffe912a1ef61","293fc44a58557a4960b567d1e835cde7173c20b1","d73eeff6309aa33d392097dad3d4e9d29e0b3303","a671fbe41544000b44f1a293b769a47941e9e11a","09514db8c728efffd2675bef716bbc82fb1aafa2","518d7fb9d0e92c4f0c98ad196e870d297839142a","055948df329a8be6ea042a5f66b45a9119005dfb","ecf4e71449bd87e24cd7fc72b5f0ffe89c593a69","5be3e4df500560ffb53b82d8beb49e0a86ae177b","089c23c8ad7984136ff2fd225016c698ab54c663","a6e8cf832f55471a014eafeac9757957edef7eed","7a837f3a232a0a1dcc52a2f23e55a331dd392e90","294d6e7da6da15416633b356084f35575332d964","f655ca99ce519bd8af20060f5dbfd87cf263e7fd","fe7b49a4ff6d0e5fbb88e9fe8b8b614324ed589a","1a728229fba3c97953458225ca9465f782aa4686","12ca7930ebd8064345e148491d09e485624bbcd1","f990e6434f23f91e1b754278dc6c4d448e7bebc4","1e2178bb6194eb4ddc67cb36190c2f0975904ea3","1b5d888772930ac52470eb9ea02095032cd14f2d","a643e9cc0c4210011b3072d65ae5243dd7f226c1","7627e9b9a1f4f109ae24bcfb88b1856d3298c553","d6fecb59952c5593c310e230b87e04cadeba57ef","9def6b259212de597cf91f31f2b24ada3904abe8","50e47cc44bbf3c766f48e37ba640f94acaa11210","a43eaebc5f8c5cd71236f16d748110912670360a","2b739fea80b34442712cd99e5690c6aefcc009a1","f693e311b1a929c7f8e4daf6cf35f64a869f0fdd","502807921c9e1d023ca5aaebf13927d430192aa7","129e168c0f0bcbee5aa7a84eb7e1a592bd35c63e","16c86d36a050a0b7dc948af18278da333980fec3","7c57c91b41f50e073c01bff8544e06e53215a4f6","b74ed66b0eee0d9385d09dbd6569bd24d0650f96","ff9178fad555f6d2ef207b48952e30981aac1810","5552e59a2e4d5c08754430c78de89ad0c7982768","5d59780e5c7f1c5cce1f3cbb69d5b8ccbce23ec4","292401b268bb64c33ec365cebb932bc5445b842b","47189f6f46df5d583e5c9c064884bfff7528f64e","8ddc2c14f180411bb9cfc1679c387d1aafcb9844","0adbb549ece2c9e8ec7cba83240584d25fff80c3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302657"],"title":"Agent System Development Method Based on Agent Patterns","doi":"10.1145/302405.302657","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302657","venue":"ICSE"}

Specifically, iProperty aims to reduce the cost of checking properties as they are initially developed and as they co-evolve with the program. The key novelty of iProperty is to compute the differences between the new and old versions of expected properties to reduce the number and size of the properties that need to be checked during the initial development of the properties. Furthermore, property differencing is used in synergy with program behavior differencing techniques to optimize common regression scenarios, such as detecting regression errors or checking feature additions for conformance to new expected properties. Experimental results in the context of symbolic execution of Java programs annotated with properties written as assertions show the effectiveness of iProperty in utilizing change information to enable more efficient checking.","inCitations":["dccba279863e70f67a9b3e6f08f67e50586db1ee","99bc50fe668cce53b270565ef5b46621c563eed3","1a219842d5e6ee5ea9001aec38570a1a748f6354","569a01f3506a46f2df1a1db1fc5fa638ed01334f","195c3cf0f1829d03dbadc883b8cd0df962ad1ff5","fd25b92a46ac60267679e4786083fd6601814261","fe51a6efa85b5b15aaa9dd07877087f99fd6d04d","b7c6bf367ff40c605475aa08ccaab1e3de326ce4","6849c2bdae7a689eb044b8b7b415b1e59d4fa122","3f63e98ec811159372a7f5c58b15962cdd41a71b","167105b2adee5bb99adbb053e5deabc7e4c08e2c","7feb7bca4ff5dcaafe45d96569a1b0faa2d7f118","97b36d7c1383877703a549be1b30f85f4390f51d","200b41cdc439685b5c02f0fd257af55645a8234d","8df428ddccf72a5d566314dceb910cb03e4e60b5","cb6e79583e365099897e069fbe245152fc960a94"],"pdfUrls":["https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/publications/13712/download/","http://cs.txstate.edu/~g_y10/publications/YangETAL14iProperty.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568319","https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/591/Spring2018/propDiff.pdf"],"title":"Property differencing for incremental checking","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568319","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568319","venue":"ICSE"}

The approach requires the program to have an acyclic invocation structure. This restriction allows an underlying CycleFree Kernel to implicitly schedule units of concurrency and synchronize access to objects. Deadlock is avoided by the hierarchical access to objects, and programmers are freed from the traditional worries of explicit task creation and synchronization.The paper discusses real world, commercial experiences, both with explicit multi-threaded applications and with CycleFree applications. The potential pitfalls associated with programming concurrent processes are well known to those skilled in the art. The issues of race conditions, reentrancy, and cyclic deadlock can lead to transient program failure. The CycleFree methodology eliminates these sources of transient program failure, leading to more reliable and robust software. Simtrol, an A/V control systems company, used the CycleFree technology in the construction of two real-time control systems called ONGOER and Omega. Programmers with little previous real-time programming experience can easily embrace this methodology.

Software Eng.","paperAbstract":"Features are often the basic unit of development for a very large software systems and represent long-term efforts, spanning up to several years from inception to actual use. Developing an experiment to monitor (by means of sampling) such lengthy processes requires a great deal of care in order to minimize costs and to maximize benefits. Just as prototyping is often a necessary auxiliary step in a large-scale, long-term development effort, so to is prototyping a necessary step in the development of a large-scale, long-term process monitoring experiment. Therefore, we have prototyped our experiment using a representative process and reconstructed data from a large and rich feature development. This prototyping approach has yielded two interesting sets of results. First, we found that we needed to modify our experimental design. Our initial set of states did not represent the data as well as we had hoped. This is exemplified by the fact that the \"other\" category is too large. Second, we formulated some interesting conjectures about these processes on the basis of our analysis of the reconstructed data. Should they be validated by further experimentation, they will provide valuable insights not only into our particular processes, but into software processes in general. Even in conjectural form, they are very suggestive in terms of process improvement. We conclude that the prototyping effort is a necessary part of developing and installing any large-scale process monitoring experiment.","inCitations":["ababdfbcd281ecbc2661752b6b951fe450a16294","f4d90f34b17597c47b6fe3eb61ee49f900b541f0","b656d8f5de09c601f67f277111f342bf8c09cc22","6e52fcc3a98d10d8e8e602ae64dcd742bf36a338","f6a73d9d6fa6e7e3989a7782e8a6b964e07dc9fd","370349e1a7d7b1d601947ef288a2a330cb5e1d1e","15cba4a1b6a820cee5bd223f12fd0ed3ebb592ba","e098d0b109cd67823314d81997573df44f1e8768","689d928b7cd86e6a8dce79bf27fd3425a5c81435","67081ef72d2677ba68a0f6a484045c4ae7c3edc7","452b8dfa79c44adad4ab6e2fef1d916913e17253","88e984bf154ed334a8d05bb7fae91dee39d77f24","1f61cf656aba54eeb441d9987d06931f321f1c57","0df27dc0c7dd3694011c204f536cd839fbabe4cd","8b1ac776d4f1a0836409a3401c84d2363c6ca44d","151b02b7a06d2e91b610bb38aa364977fe415421","65a6c950ebb0296462b15a7f5750ebd54f0b6d84","58556f01977468615218912b43c1e84c3a1179ce","68fb2287c7163226e605f1f89662ca00a9d2a703","90d1434d3346576eb9397ba489d741eb0ac253df","d47137cfcd2a7285c887da4d1be014eef4062dea","021d99fd777c224eed7116419f7eed592bf61671","2f62774f24d0b24b8158b9c6e55fc483d6d82fc9","7062818fdf9c15cf6cbfaea42faae723fdbe1e30","16871ff145bffd1ab1cc63887acb3f124d3a94ab","9dbf6518297bfe8cb19ec61c2cb8104120386140","118e713665b9705d7f11d432d74944268a3b8964","da0ba488ee49415eb4b0fc2fe73c718755759238","a18f4a8374c2f90040ff5e0acf1c62db716611ce","f9ffc61def64865176588b36272ca552d55203ea","9dbb18383677a11662e07e843da7b09ffac20225","51bcfbfe134a65d7009b1327202f8436a57bb8b2","5b7008622426b6100c344efff4a76832e7d47400","f93d178ac7e10454931ac4d0762750be32fe693b","751bac3e49c8ce13a890a502c3b85e0a0776a7c6","0714df6cf97037d7f5c0ba2b9566f3d165b17c39","82e8340a38086874c5dcc6f50df8a2dea63dc9e6","c39df274db6b4cb7791aa0e7fa82062d7dfe5ecc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse15.ps.gz","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse20-10.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry////work/papers/tse20-10.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry////work/papers/icse15.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse15.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/32.328994","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/382c/p3.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/tse20-10.pdf","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse15.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257572.257605","https://csdl.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/1993/3700/00/00346048.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse20-10.pdf","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/tse20-10.ps.gz"],"title":"Prototyping a Process Monitoring Experiment","doi":"10.1109/32.328994","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.328994","venue":"ICSE"}

To attain project success, the project management, in which the final status of project is estimated, must be incorporated.In this paper, we consider estimation of the final status(that is, successful or unsuccessful) of project by applying Bayesian classifier to metrics data collected from project. In order to attain high estimation accuracy rate, we must select only a set of appropriate metrics to be applied. Here we consider two selection methods: the first method by the experts and the second method by the statistical test.Then we conducted an experiment using 28 project data and 29 metrics data in an organization of a certain company. The result showed that the method by the test gave higher accuracy rates than the method by the experts, and Bayesian classifier with the test method is effective to estimate project success.","inCitations":["d0ad16833f609e03f57fe06b2eff4cad3e08b5d2","c897167ca8deafde2cde333cbd04f84a4255e8da","6e137dde45b253ad9ae43bd0f36bc93475791856","0b3abb5e29bac18714431817ca020553887e9234","a787e37c7eac69f5d3bfa91bb711b2fea4226f3f","af57b5913545bc7f98d302efd4b7b20dc24ef0d9","9914544634a9f55f399fd1653aab69dfe4dcbb6a","1e14cd507b6407da1eba45a83dd52e890bf24419","5347b61f4ceb6c1afba46f93fbd33b15b9a2349a","abcb5c6b3d68ec9e586ff53c7caf88077dd9a18d","4c605df25fa09815f6f5d130c7cd777f6a3c177f","24b9c7bd86d7d2dd02dd5ac65354e86f811ac1a5","df5ff23e5aa81364f8bfdd737949ab5e063b57f5","55b5567495774e1be55e414cba04e6f7be07c25b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www-ise4.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/paper/data/pdf/56.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134371"],"title":"Estimation of project success using Bayesian classifier","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134371","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134371","venue":"ICSE"}

This acceptance is largely based on studies using procedural program code. This paper presents empirical evidence that raises significant questions about the application of inspection to object-oriented code.\nA detailed analysis of the 'hard to find' defects during an inspection experiment shows that many of them can be characterised as 'delocalised' — the information needed to recognise the defect is distributed throughout the software. The paper shows that key features of object-oriented technology are likely to exaggerate delocalisation.\nAs a result, it is argued that new methods of inspection for object-oriented code are required. These must address: partitioning code for inspection (“what to read”), reading strategies (“how to read”), and support for understanding what isn't read — “localising the delocalisation”.","inCitations":["152037101c4536161d831ccd808598862d49478a","3577bd979bff4b26e7e0ac6a758bfeeb66a53fd2","4d8c796b9a09c760e1732cd3480819046cf60fb7","8742a2cf791839c1d3c48dc2ebb05db7157a6605","0e3f15562e2ac85cf885cab853678b4ed3450593","a7d90cebd279de78687bb8e58b832c1badd9967e","ab03aad37902e579fe56eab9f6558acee8a6f5a1","85057970da1bd856993435d1fce6f0398eeef3ee","5e85e3e204e9ab8210e24e32049b727ff9d47563","31cf653693149005142082bb105759eecb5984ec","ffc4e86276a5489ff07013d15ccdc2866c1305aa","acb2794651877b9e923f2268828ae892a7915d85","63c5a7c8383917f7f7d1d9fb6a9eee7b42ab5b97","757b9313f2860e0d0f4439e805a022cfc54094e1","c676f83740744e0ea0e2188c85c20ad0d753444a","5e4fb5c1c98013c794e7923b4212f387f1f34225","358491d224ad000a07456acebcabd659c95464e3","bf2cbf1bd4b61991b14ad5ecc0d50496e86bd7cd","2be0e5f3a9fbbd1d49a9043329f0d5dd1511f112","99358a9148069f04e2bb6522263ae49096db2819","53e21466acefa955175bb5d3e771a64ff486b389","3f0abdf494aec9d2809046cb0a9df81f0b25dd53","4190c600bd875ee89272e8c2bf8fed9b70e96df4","7f3f7e217dba431c99cf12ee1d97c61cee5c3911","400537c12dfd7add2286fb51cf3103702637844b","1873f596782405591be3c36c85f61e72dc0033c8","1b75a939babc671e98d14d3fde4ffc309cb2cc98","31fcd36c6d8055fc555de2d17a83d9008c7f6421","ae9ef753476af945481414b9375fb2007918b2e4","b2f6037f949a2bddc662ba604e32295fd5d67e17","8b16a9b1eb45ffb5bb8fa3cdd52c9e7d679d2cd0","f116fe9aeee586f7431448afdfd6b8a1b4efb237","3d6157f1b46ded12cd687c5cb516c4d4836b16d9","994adf41bcbad46200e30da3a1a6c996614b1282","2d5da22184b127c4f5d096b02226c5bda9510c06","35ca014cecd7cdb03ffd40cf7dbc5d1981a86722","276b8a87f3910d781685c7d827ea9491b6af57a7","6789fe4a27eef636e944cafd819592f6a3ff8880","ac1ae6e1774a62ac9a50576bcfa39ce32a9481e1","23f3b10d1dc1ac91b0ec9eb067cdf0375fc5348c","796b7f8b45666f21e19b81a7c46b6709ca7695ae","6ea2fd135dd45c99fcbf8a55d1770eb494bb49c4","3a6bf8316149cb57791e3f40450e0d2231e59f4e","b5be512ada256b90ca3857f21c7311609f4ae563","45950dc2b4325be0d3acaaf9d31f2e5eec9e573b","68b676a76c5f0d93c893f3a50c8e56bae6e6e314","5071b2b6611d2ee7b755b49ef78b46e942037d71","085f2fbdd12d3119b73a4ecb383feaf939c0fab8","cbc33fdad31aafcec0084c36d5366e7c1b2d985a","a8ce9ce0ca482ff32a3799b803991e3cd20011de","adf9753013533615367f9767c4965c7620c54716","168147ad7ab259b9e38734defd8bb68c367de9cd","75705ec27a3955ac585cf3b010fb7dbe0af2c4b4","38dc1e3b7b01df6e7ef0717fd86b5ba159053012","5600aff895ee977da91571907c5b9184cd2e828c","d00f05449d02634741c2a4cc86c4a5d3711f7c41","52022ad9330eaa0a70e08caab1beeabc1b45d933","d2eacb8bd04119fefe3e43c842dd3c7a287bfe7f","25965375c16d9138a8dfd57f7692271100f98767","6edccda5b5e3bdb5db3c65ee5cb8e5b5ce5a4501","1544da0e9aae3dabf5335e7f52e80511f2dd5519","5cfd0ff17a2bea0643931d2689a2a3fee7138848"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337343"],"title":"Object-oriented inspection in the face of delocalisation","doi":"10.1145/337180.337343","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337343","venue":"ICSE"}

We characterize the two processes and their main activities and introduce the orthogonal variability modeling approach (OVM). We further illustrate the OVM approach in the product line requirements engineering and product line testing activities.","inCitations":["b0d916edc8ee9f4f2e19e117e855164997fab006","b483191bec65ab95b66b8e5d50b1d569c6222f6d","9f84fb4b6c604a4bbe11a2b22fa221a4d67fbc76","77d3868d79a7df972b9ff4a270b70edb5e96d34b","7e2ec1495542b3196d3e305ff0f6995b86fba8f5","8eaf3af684274b52dc586cdfb59e012678930cd6","9511aede1e5984b7a8b44875e956b6981c9487d8","3a1953d35e784114ce85c46da941fc9bbd654a02","04fe744a1896f49606c1c1b7c591358cf28b0854","a87f067bf0ae67dcb864b5c4dff7f4218ba16b4d","cade8305dd858e5af63b5677e9d4e655d6f0e91a","afe2c31c357ecaacec23befc4f6d7c182ac17abd","2698b7c749c8d9e90925543500ee20192f82cccd","9b04a7e40169e909dd2c3417733dbbb23f2df6f7","f360e331985f3b17e34ac37fa1c84157e2801bbe","c0319ff1fbad30d2c8ea7055dae76b3e1c2f43ac","c7e0e5ba5988f08d6a643f8efd18a1c9f13b687c","62b3ab0c01447739935f8651804a9e6184ee9747","cee1d06e4d2b4eee787e82a66196c1fa6c392298","8bc35759cae5080ce1b92400d65af0d9a5619282","eb46afbb6af046cde11175f3d51ff7b567f305bc","d10d009c9035af8f4932446311ca061bff94241d","393177a002bf10a29cb1382b53a73c28e251976f","c5c2025185310ea964ae87a1a3c41ce3ac6f1f01","21ef45f51d0b937766737fbb1a80c518b53a5d13","3431288f6b06eae7cdff286886eb2046a317edbd","5c3727e178d97bb3c8192abe38372cc57a2a95b6","e4b552772996d3ebf91ac9984de4b36569b86f7e","92567996aaff77b602ebd79c41297cfcc6423a1d","82b52b27a23cfb130c167aaab21a523dc5dd59cd","dfb45546e8c7b314a91d33f1d58334ce4d821d41","d9b991fc23137af9f90f3584ea45bb049fa1d69e","b479069480c504b547b130d0e4ff3fe1b2b5d9f5","4c2f6db5df0af38fa9388487eefc94930f8962cd","12eaf08901ed8ccdc10731e5dcd13a1b6e9cfbf6","39f1978bc538b8f24b171bbe951ab7b7ddf6c6f7","47b22b236c99fbadecc65adefaeb76d97d1bf0c1","10eeeb1cb72b63781703805104cd5fb92994c3f7","7a52ad5a6377d1c66117f76aff98edde00eff37a","e06526afb412199985e870098dbf20d9913b2cdf","fcdd0c2583d1385a65a78c452f995e34127823a7","e861e3c6af0999de8736a214f054a4077212f2bb","3c20d67af809c203a7fa025742ad261cbf147acf","b47ab79286bbb2bba4d6b131789d747f6f30a256","6ce2dddeab7e46b942a4dac18e937b45a2b74db6","8b4d9ab240580cd27436a7a61f29402420049ce0","e1301860c81d4897849090cd8016eaa7530f5c49","4f4ff2c053bb5fada69f99908d345100ac92a77b","6aa2db41ac587c6a8df11df5e77b331b108c6f94","67b0a55a766245db607494dfa8bb721fc8f6f71d","eb43f6f84b40f525d87ecf0e0e031e29b8f7e218","24c471f294ff427704955a7fe1582efce0c4b4c3","3fe3f247035cc30b39f5266f6a81271ced9971e2","98ea59dd93a82227e04edc50694bd7a6aaf48831"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134499"],"title":"Variability management in software product line engineering","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134499","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134499","venue":"ICSE"}

It characterizes the software processes used by software managers and practitioners at the assessed sites and classifies issues identified during the assessments. The basis for the characterization and classification is a software process maturity model developed by the SEI. This report contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the state of practice of software engineering in the United States by characterizing the sites from a software process maturity perspective and profiling site software process weaknesses. The data analyzed are drawn from SEI software process assessments of 59 government and industry software sites. This work is an analysis of existing assessment data rather than a designed study. The participating sites were not randomly selected; accordingly, they do not necessarily constitute a statistically valid sampling of the U.S. software Industry. 1 Overview 1 .1 Scope and Objectives This report focuses on the state of practice of software engineering from a software process perspective, it characterizes the software processes used by software managers and practitboners using a five-level process maturity model developed at the SEI, and classifies process issues identified during SEI assessments conducted at 59 government and industry software sites. The scopo of this report does not explicitly consider other important determinants of software supplier performance such as human resource management, automation, business strategy and practices. A commitment to Improve key software processes on a continuing basis is rapidly becoming a high priority for many U.S. software organizations. Among the reasons for this are: 1. Process capability is being increasingly recognized (across many industries) as a key determinant of performance and a source of competitive advantage, 2. Software suppliers (both government and industry) are subject to intensifying competitive pressures, and 3. Software purchasers are becoming Increasingly sophisticated and demanding. Of particular Importance to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) software community is the Increasing use by the DoD of SEI-developed methods such as software capability evaluation for Identifying capable contractors during the acquisition phase and for monitoring the results of process improvement programs during contract performance. The objective of this report Is to provide a baseline characterization of the state of software process maturity for a group of 59 U.S. government and industry software sites. A clear understanding of current software process strengths and weaknesses Is an important initial step towards formulating plans to improve them in an orderly, progressive and sustainable way.","inCitations":["7588c5f7cc699d7a071e85e08eb98d514e9c73f8","f7654ae82f594df6cf535a57e462a4b7ef359616","75a0049903436907b904536bfb60b80df38993cf","21d136f2441c6d53bcfb4842abd9f774eebc3c10","94e58b734436a3836818b3c5f7ec1cb435da0334","b9874d1bb5fbf6d3f6bccf6c60da04477027e06f","34dc591c29ce26cbff0079df408e9961be89475a","f9e0e4c46b949544bfd2837458c5bb745cee8ed5","0346b92d7bd7bb3a121daf426ec99af35b03b90d","23ae960458304ebdaca4a05cd29150bbbe6e6350","540420a19a2d703f9223684f8fb433955c04bb94","6cb628091c017d6ce72058d7002be636c81cee16","b47a465b9bfbebaecb67a99626431e501078d8ba","57db099c05ddaa0bb8a1fdc3ded6631050761357","8ae70e016009d28c52a8a8b71c278cb6b7ef4e2d","3339b20cb7fa8cf51e48b42b6785e20e221de16f","2d2f609de3c6d694b88b5b987b05bd5ec53be372","2a8bc4e405082c083e32df4ab55e7c217fba2f6f","5a7ff2abf4839f63beb8b47606950c4d7a4d55ae","450c4c1be1347414d8185b273a1e64da1b7917c3","c2bca1606d76870b359e41c24efdb71acaff56bc","b31059dd0b4ba5c35f3a769f51408cc954eef315","e469636ad5a1eacf5fe5df07c946ce9e2dc88c3a","9c8715a9f276935c2325ed630b710955fad7d866","c00569c322ddabb8ccc368d50495f19cf1fe0edb","45b1e495bbf8e0928a089c35b3d3bbcd9db0b61e","546dad795652465c6988c9b732e902597c58aec9","afa2f1aa9dce904104dd7fcc26a748fb5e24dc77","5717b62b16611bab8d3fb12997f7ed7f5c651860","da10206e7b7fe033d91cdbc5925ee581ea77dc7f","248cef43bb058dde542ac6cb7d504b7b75f6ea94","044eea93085d8fc44ba7455cd43bbc71473e75b7","1bc5f5f707cf92923d96fc3abf59b701982f757b","8c52c9ce9ed203cbd64fa2f99baab6820858f653","62836e578456f36e4cc56abb6dd467374688fead","190311b625d5314ea621d24db21516055c699424","144e2bb7dd3fd09803611d55de74a0d01bd023c0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/92tr024.pdf","http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=sei","http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalReport/1992_005_001_16094.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257572.257594","https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalReport/1992_005_001_16094.pdf"],"title":"An Analysis of SEI Software Process Assessment Results: 1987-1991","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Existing APR approaches use unit tests or constraint solving to find and validate program patches. We propose Canonical Search And Repair (CSAR), a program repair technique based on semantic search which uses a canonical form of the path conditions to characterize buggy and patch code and allows for easy storage and retrieval of software patches, without the need for expensive constraint solving. CSAR uses string metrics over the canonical forms to cheaply measure semantic distance between patches and buggy code and uses a classifier to identify situations in which test suite executions are unnecessary-and to provide a finer-grained means of differentiating between potential patches.\n We evaluate CSAR on the IntroClass benchmark, and show that CSAR finds more correct patches (96% increase) than previous semantic search approaches, and more correct patches (34% increase) than other previous state-of-the-art in program repair.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449568"],"title":"Automated program repair with canonical constraints","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3194999","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3194999","venue":"ICSE"}

Throughout the history of Eclipse the development team was successful in hitting projected delivery dates with precision and quality. This isn't possible without a team strongly committed to ship quality software. How is this really done? How does Eclipse achieve quality and just-in-time delivery? This talk sheds light on the key practices of the Eclipse development process from the development mantras \"Always Beta\", \"Milestones First\", \"API First\", and \"Performance First\" to practices such as ensuring quality through multiple feedback loops. Erich will reflect on proven practices for managing a large project performed by geographically dispersed teams and open source contributors in a highly competitive market. Most of these practices have evolved in the open source project, but they are equally applicable to closed source projects and will help to improve quality, timeliness and reduce development stress in both types of environments.

To date most work has focused upon algorithmic cost models such as COCOMO and Function Points. These can suffer from the disadvantage of the need to calibrate the model to each individual measurement environment coupled with very variable accuracy levels even after calibration. An alternative approach is to use analogy for estimation. We demonstrate that this method has considerable promise in that we show it to out perform traditional algorithmic methods for six different datasets. A disadvantage of estimation by analogy is that it requires a considerable amount of computation. The paper describes an automated environment known as ANGEL that supports the collection, storage and identification of the most analogous projects in order to estimate the effort for a new project. ANGEL is based upon the minimisation of Euclidean distance in n-dimensional space. The software is flexible and can deal with differing datasets both in terms of the number of observations (projects) and in the variables collected. Our analogy approach is evaluated with six distinct datasets drawn from a range of different environments and is found to outperform other methods. It is widely accepted that effective software effort estimation demands more than one technique. We have shown that estimating by analogy is a candidate technique and that with the aid of an automated environment is an eminently practical technique.","inCitations":["0a1def01c2839ba2d0e5b11c533d951cbb977ec2","f1f96512f09f459c5c2970ed376931d4b7bfc8bd","0912988680f4b0219c12c594c2b6d59cd758e66f","be9c292f255fd00c3769600913c2878221e99aec","ba464e7f26ac4a65dace73e6b7a21f5600106018","6fd5cbb951d60efe875fdeee5acf6aacb2701c7b","a6eb3efdbc3b4e0c37f6ddaf3b3591caf3fe990b","133e803febcf7c4366a781810145f4fce55e76d6","5c971ba2759f62ac40dc721b6cf9b102dabd4672","389bd6af128e315bacf8c98b106a1ed764d39a30","33d36012aed74782427d423490db0d19d7ec331c","646c65e11f2bbb44b5b8d01e624c58a1669d3529","bfaa52cf0441789cf3d608600edfdc522242e0e2","1770d561e4e0ce4da408f4ce042cc593ff7f0739","0a3fb935e414e60ac7245fccb4c92bc6d19340dd","7912442a8aab10f085367e76f911c039c844226a","4cbbb3c2869a044154e743e14dc84356c59d6af0","dc048710e5a16d91557e320ab46267f1c84c7f23","7c14d72ea06681f5ca279d89ba4a8e7888929e9b","a4a48b5d4a13e1aaac0e2ca26bd172e58b16fef5","5c61329520907dbc949e078d5f5795385ff58a6b","df5484ecad8ba6f498b53720d7504b2d89450405","203ba1dd3dd3c51ce55320012a673287b15bd46f","94de19ea370f036d5187f7e5dec307fa2d421c73","c557b7727419b9237377a593157c258231e6a25c","f926e9e170c5899c678d78f8099da2040c7ee552","7d28a104a5a87924bde0a0b2f17ee23f39746230","47be8a190f6aa1a0e960384b707e249817f9aa64","3a8681678f7ead36463423d9edf4047638693895","71787a367c002a027639a10fa7c61b600a3fb8dd","6eec53dac7706dbced4d875bd5ce0d10047d29c7","44d4f14e21a5e60a9e6f9e329e862de87f32a4df","28101ecee219e05ffff14ecaa28b608129b5d237","ad4cd1c7a16a030f2cf3c17907f5897a05e51264","73d0fe214d2c5626b54a74c53ba65519e450c592","9306088d578e1ffd2b0a82a785e5d55e2b29894d","295303347ceb270af48bea42019e86e85f13e146","772dab712e9259307cf0290e9bab1bbf2feaf948","c05ce05680a34c97b0238344614a492f170581f1","786d6600a701166fa7ea11936a53d9f9a9b4fe70","2d1eabb23922cd93ea3ccd56cb1222689d20df9a","e6bc95ce3acd8eb91ba8484ba173d53000d9573e","127e1d5b329ddd0a370390f0e25a602fe1553d54","33259c71965ae0160752b9383da5c80e43b36c92","6da0a4c42432966ced9cb1243061e77a6910c09d","0a7c406bb80e3535e10f4bb949244eac4d12d0c1","75737da614517b182e32d88c7e7b33b3aabf8646","731cc0aba4cef9a7ff7fb7eee67b05e9bf06df86","5b85db736825ef3e016d12c5c740f985f9bf499f","6ba99656bb69a91b95383b3f24b35c50100122c7","10d7db796a293085d19e56af2d40de9f9a7a114a","1d37cd2849fe1fc704bf25ae492eb239c745e1b4","59b5d9c15296ab0de3dc550e5c93900c50dc761f","48f520d1a761012a8a05dfcf125011e8b9d51313","52cec4434bcf5f274c2cf0d918193018abebddb5","acff1bc91a59f607d6d4bd961ce91e7c752364e1","bc1aab16040099c41fb959ddb14328e73242e1c1","4a4ea1473147663caccef07e9651629762f44a58","bd018c06cb7da8af3299f52a0c595fc68f670699","a805e55f6afd57bb1a7aa01cfb375743934f578c","e8e4acdc533070b5c645e65c8253537f026eb99b","5a01ff00f24cb29b9e96b5af4253343bca17e0a7","3765a4945021260f7f05ca339722e950a04414dd","725986c4db8bd1196c3ba7a1a609d70c6b1790a7","67d9903b40d60d2423c4978973aa4c49d3d477d0","1f18a1e026fda7d7d81cbb9495d313b4cd810cba","60fa443da59004c699fa00ba2ea6de700b5ba068","ca8fd4cfb34802393c8cd79343d9e41939453cab","ff162bb35f2be79fe6827296dd4e374c862b8e45","e9fbb16fa449ff6efb9fe50d7fb34987f5f4c9f6","885e55db8eee1902d62dbd78aaad53bf927c591e","9df78c1cb168e188bdf62075d2bacfb540fe8930","14bd8ee801fd95d329547bfbef4ffd338b3e5f0e","228e30ec8b3ef426afa69ddc12333324e320a88e","689592e022f9ec5c362b92b82442a8616ded89dd","4f04f21b8e668e3609e1ef2afcdf0d80780529a5","e345deeda580a3de0abf7ca4cfb56e93bfaeaf00","cd47a55cb1020288c501e4a3047b2f7ed038bc2f","c693f2f48f5e94527599e4dd5d2f88abb558f1fc","165319bd5b416d00fe7d6c56805cc6bf7bd82501","50cf798768e9c57fc984c22b6b726a40621846ad","70bef37f7f45102120387a0bc7721346f1dca3b9","079b3dd08fa3c5d389fc31c6e9e2520ad6de70d1","45d87ba272f5f66e0c0e15371acbf7d2c4a3cf27","197b0b33d9221923f983d827d37a8f17e09023ad","649196afa6ee992720374b247d9e535b4c13101e","1d5150c9ffd4e6874e187521a181302bf12ef3f5","12a640786c2cc692a8123ea8ae8cce036b3b6dea","ce748fc96219535626870fdaaed8c63ef78aad4f","70e8b1e2ddd7bdaa6571ba520e40ba198e6df4d2","4ae3b142eee847348e4dbbe313c733526946345d","58c8daa501ea3732ec7bdc5735ac89162e344651","c7aea3612d0dd932f9a6c051a730485e3bf5f86a","e18409e4f8f54ce98e0246392f15f65a3562d963","591722d918596d33b319df1ff3a8ddf6777b51c1","f9c389b295b2eec169078bdb25c766d5f666f505","538bb64fc6bd226303439e9809c03f1efd77b93f","69bf08a330aa5bf631e60412f8d86c2f5b8f2790","9be27aed1ece462f73ac0f5b260d28e42306fe72","05dc6e782dc7ddeb2e32a190fcab6551a4c54b66","943da2bb363c06319218ee204622bb10f816490f","674bbe3474d93fbefee1a5e7d87382d96c97cf3b","07250022c71a56333145014356983a43281dd134","c75cd2ad38bf8cd860740d311afb23830b04f332","7a350d22319872d3626feb4e79215b1f84e16668","fbf679e35e130bbb3d141f6e58ef40a92c669a2d","948a8c329ef73a45c48a6a4439bc0dc475ded2a4","042967969e4d5f9ea2493ed57f8e36d3c10b8c55","5bd6324e5d546cfd5ec79dae40919d67e7551d66","419bec3681fce90d742cf48b6c148383f5d94a42","c098dbff923cefc482c95dd624c3328284441d21","786fe38a6f1cdf8dddd25fd855c23d1eff9782f5","d9bd1735139fe0366632c9417ebe3e9727d20e6f","38cc302b9204c222316a2ed34813f16d42e5c7b4","973e69c85d94d73426aab80669b317cd9b661c49","2f4be19304d36a55d1debf33d6c

This improvement process is aimed at the global software process model as well as methods and tools supporting that model. The basic idea is to use defect profiles to help characterize the environment and evaluate the project goals and the effectiveness of methods and tools in a quantitative way. The improvement process is implemented iteratively by setting project improvement goals, characterizing those goals and the environment, in part, via defect profiles in a quantitative way, choosing methods and tools fitting those characteristics, evaluating the actual behavior of the chosen set of methods and tools, and refining the project goals based on the evaluation results.

In practice, there is a gap between what is prescribed by guidelines and what is implemented in practice, making it difficult for organizations and certifiers to fully evaluate the safety of the software system. In this paper we present an approach, which parses a guideline to extract a Traceability Model depicting software artifact types and their prescribed traces. It then analyzes the traceability data within a project to identify areas of traceability failure. Missing traceability paths, redundant and/or inconsistent data, and other problems are highlighted. We used our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven safety-critical software systems and found that none of the evaluated projects contained traceability that fully conformed to its relevant guidelines.","inCitations":["1cc22b90c888aed1afdcb47a1a90817965eeaae8","c556f148555db65a534c41a72a9ec0bece2802bf","789aafdc764ba4e91df9bb5ddc16ae8c098dffd9","8d5ccbb9d414469cbef9393c9bfae43fd2b9ee8d","a29285dfbd8f4193e8290d0ec08aa084a2db0e35","e49c621810ab444af9f4503ab0093cc7c414b12e","1f1d7720b1a153b5af8ec707a116c8d08a0a8210","c3a7f3d65e9c3542b5083828960c383eddbfa31c","2807a9882f15c06d6d0820faab2fb280ad704a6b","d0e35cc163d98397f6a3cbb4b0a25c5eb3aab356","3e93620a33c743387937a55dda19955a2b21cdf4","c576c95e6538130ec3bdce50b9f4eb6585753b49","65916a3706290041bd826d0784b9f0da927df916","fd9e74dbeea7b78a96c5b1dfdb8e62e8160e10cc","d31ca57df819df137cba54a7624552dd6baf8e8d","7a7e950adffbf7b509f1bdfd26186fe09654c6bf","03a88fafea6002ed3eaa9818ba1b61f0b70379d3","fa2859b540e22c29450c9e03756012a09ee3fd84","3d5952ee1e3e602addbe3b83b9190090137dd17b","fc3d386b3aa0033a5eb7a63034b2bb4e5334e1c4","78b1ecaf3ee866228d4e56de0512078429b7cb78","1b2959b06e93ee43aa7d3bb6ca81c21d179b55d9","2845734fb853d24e2cb0abe1f5527049e01ecf90","4cb5a35aed64c5a68c500507dae94e5c08261e4b","c00aaa5e96fd4f0f5422e55312ef9def63fc72c4","e8d82955b9d4b32492c2e92be1d261d9c0a6cf2b","a4dc595dc2000a973318a323fd75f36f56a6f732","c4efe8dbe8630f5ee184ce00873add487998729b","131e8a461d7ed4183c4c5d35d9a0ce6def24a54a","0a10ec64edc69a307ad3ea52bf28c59e2653e240","0b7f2cfbabe7da9d9e6bde136ef04db63e21f15f","5aac90f2f3b50e06ccfe1e7117f5585706d6af87","a10e6282f5b6f6c50c354e5e749a50df7f9a6c73","7836008e53ec7dafae8e37d783b71540d1eb2321","321368b5e78b86f515bb72d3a2b0b8b8b934888c","1b3cf2e1d12226e012ca789015c1042f7c03143c","64a36d33a884a69fb201b1a00c6d8bf304fc4bf1","b0403cde232e0e7867edf47bc00fe0d6ba7ab595"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.patrickmaeder.de/pdf/ICSE14_rempelEtAL_TraceabilityConformanceGuidelines.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56066685"],"title":"Mind the gap: assessing the conformance of software traceability to relevant guidelines","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568290","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568290","venue":"ICSE"}

In particular, the \"component trust problem\" refers to how adequate guarantees and documentation about a component' s behaviour can be transferred from the component developer to its potential users. The capability to test a component when deployed within the target application environment can help establish the compliance of a candidate component to the customer's expectations and certainly contributes to \"increase trust\". To this purpose, we propose the CDT framework for Component Deployment Testing. CDT provides the customer with both a technique to early specify a deployment test suite and an environment for running and reusing the specified tests on any component implementation. The framework can also be used to deliver the component developer's test suite and to later re-execute it. The central feature of CDT is the complete decoupling between the specification of the tests and the component implementation.","inCitations":["8e66938d2fed031c72e9f5b50f9716fe636958f2","fef5d75693043c8f045bf48e9f581c8be0f76635","1168f267ad844b231dfa44438d5d587ad66772b2","3899585a4cea99b2f489a1676f14a4b475a4a49e","a222ca20a235c087efeab06917c5cef004d0678a","347cd6697fa45e1b50b40b1d6f4a12bbfce47b51","01473bcf5fad53fa5475fef57f0000291d4e37bb","88d0e1ead34a4b1f8032702a6d4cdaa7eaef7fd9","fe2bd5558d1dd56b7a1254e2ad69e28a3aec557a","7fa3beb7e3ef16cbed7fc03f640e105f3cd41d4f","37d77ef691e7a8c837ae015cb8ad3506242af43c","6dedeb7a22d60eee801f4769986c04b97e3e6101","c98b198da701c21bea4907881361e2595d51858f","6af2d70ceaeeacd89118ed80e1a09b94562630ed","64f5c72ac3dceb46bc82ac29e8b1237a374a040a","ce2391b1f1ba4f3cdb4b5a1570ff2998f3512ce7","29b718c67e14b898bb99827c9954cedef34825c1","e0d4ae631546710a6817e92a1a084d631ddf0d8a","13a3685761de126d959ce3e1aaec1f302c6aeab8","b5867207e5c7da08e9219afe3bd4e7d96e77c7fe","3eb9fc86313a493a1d2b4f80538d7e661a6f049c","5fa79f002504eb4f52fcf50990254ca59c906dc3","c6a9267593b326d1d13e1ecf16dbe13aaae1e3df","e195bd0fef2313a3f79e3db9ac1598ef2636b34e","a10229fb83491356c5e7bc8c2287bd0719de369b","47c1711c5e53317cd4cd61351d0a52cb385b443f","a1cc200f967da64917b1890de6cff889beb4bed5","a422e46d5a394aa5583c174349d455f0aa25866a","4a6f6e698e89085735a0614aac443905742ac447","fd617cfc0c4267df67ed89afaf34421c7c75f3d1","93c3b9ca6a7378697d88d076164c108d0b815731"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iei.pi.cnr.it/~polini/downloads/icse03/icse2003.pdf","http://www1.isti.cnr.it/~polini/downloads/icse03/icse2003.pdf","https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/361/463/a_framework_for_component_deployment_testing.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776843"],"title":"A Framework for Component Deployment Testing","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Designing applications that meet user behaviors, by efficiently supporting the prevalent navigation patterns, and evolving with them requires new approaches that go beyond classic software engineering solutions. We present a novel approach that automates the acquisition of user-interaction requirements in an incremental and reflective way. Our solution builds upon inferring a set of probabilistic Markov models of the users' navigational behaviors, dynamically extracted from the interaction history given in the form of a log file. We annotate and analyze the inferred models to verify quantitative properties by means of probabilistic model checking. The paper investigates the advantages of the approach referring to a Web application currently in use.","inCitations":["26576df64f71277620f873d044d092086bc3d804","70853a335e575ca596c00734b92f81268d126dca","2187b3d7e05c4c37c1ad58076098ecc4366ed121","cb1c07c3f25796deffed7c6eeb05b3ca5151948e","022c15c0815f9256133d34480dd429d68325984b","290e6d5955000d87b077afe9b42f6750398cc866","8bf04f7a505d40c933285ffd4746f58f4a39e894","63304481157688e13f211dad6a71fd7fae2378d6","6cfab75bed3852a78d4f648c6ed6b84c515d234c","0c007dbc25c576bbc4f60758270c0f466349a70b","18fb865dfe6a88c974004d67fd98b857a91cd12b","5a4ef9aa1632b32fdac50d228c7b0e48d70e5ae2","e828892b37cf504790016eed5b19eae2a9d20d87","fe31b53e71d671628ff6af0f18475ea3e115f84c","2c7c0c9e23a1f4ac8c063fd971f7d65c2776a669","2da84b7782ddf300da20f00ae2da9a521f20fed4","c126cdc5ada41c6920f5527219254c7c4636cb1b","6c3d905a82d0132b7ff06e415c03ed252a82ff1f","25638e2bc23ac3fe8325b6a1c813d270206a4c16","a39ee505b94b3056b783464cae8d7a5d6d3f53f0","7a0676acefc870176d85e20e42aac652d6db2550","504cd96aed27687319b6b1f1ad47206db8482a90","30228ff967dbdc880c386d6220d1e4173d9d63fe","08573bcd34af3d7def27e49b61b324e85485bd1f","eaa1d69e7fd3f6a66a4b590fec6044fb46ab03f8","69a613dd7ab8aeea0029790e6927f94a607bec67","51aa24f536a0ba50d289f645c7cf54961e2eab7d","31e9916f0cdc65d2334b804b9df808168682112c","6bdf114ec59eac1f3a6f82a268ffbc91eeacb31c","7636d74078875d9361f21cca71731d8bcf589aef","745589aa4c3b602e8274931ad5832ecd11c08193","095aed5a23cb1c807bbc9ffa40d1ae82c6685d43","4dec2eac67b5a3d4b74b700ad6532c9ca21ee45b","24f4bac812bef13f5552c7dbf3c58bf692f0492e","997c4201b4360c52729a7c3073364ffc3b383a8d","fa3ec50cbdbc4c879e87c03a71ece7e8a15c8838","ab5d57c2042c60d6b4f887d1d0d90fa20b2e0116","2e7d283fd0064da3a97fef9562a8cc1bd55fa84a","3848cae346a4856e66a9f6b6ad21be83575c695d","02068aaecb11eb883c61cd3f579a6e390e833b69","16f35a923c059354ae4bd55f4da39b697239f4b2","d58e3896daae93b53b2f0edb91ac6cd98cf6b286","cba1718a995c4a928f5da84075bad74752fc33ab","de49909b59bce1b7ff4fbda53ec30b01eefae5c0","f58c60a1f361acf2cccea7008243c6b6115dc748","794e4f8506440e6d7f11e9d68700fd5d1c2a4fd3","1fe8d5f8206c2c14763f6242ee731b12cad2dcf6"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568234","http://qwik.jp/se-reading/10.download/G12.pdf","http://giordano.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/icse14.pdf"],"title":"Mining behavior models from user-intensive web applications","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568234","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568234","venue":"ICSE"}

Our approach is based on the notion of control. We envision distributed, hierarchical, adaptive, multiple model, discretestate control systems to monitor infrastructure information systems and respond to disruptions (e.g., security attacks) by changing operating modes and design configurations to minimize loss of utility. Controlling legacy information systems presents some significant challenges. To explore and evaluate our approach, we have developed a toolkit for building distributed dynamic models of infrastructure information systems. We used this toolkit to build a model of a simple subset of the United States payment system and a control system for this model information system.","inCitations":["6894ed4ca4fa33e9034410b4f78a82b5ecde009f","763dfb57f2c4c0eca9cbe59e198cc92a20b764de","05d6a965ecb9145c112b499baec81c3603bbc867","4b0ceab32b339e04b6209d5f2d355fbb0b972e01","81350ae686fe9cf343501f5b177948dfbf647730","23952b90dd3acc93f62837749e6da269147792e8","c264a30e200392d85ebfbb6636c1b6a80f72006a","3639e2590846b90030eb7a10a6ca6a3459c124ca","675e75c459312890b4494ba6a97bc70f78897dd9","077b401d2600e5d7a8ef047f312fb83dfdb042e7","2e85ca83502d648d244a9a147167cd421f0b0028","47f09360b1ea3e8b0e0041324c538763f57a3ff6","005c5c16aefb32d34ae9e1fa6df9c45172068008","6b03224c82ed883d42c980a61c3cd113c4f36a3b","3040510538e19f03b67c2e9753f3f6e2f4f828ba","4180e7bc51385b9c601d6afb6b811d09accad17f","62a9895907aa4ffe106bb169b7e6a6bd3bbf5628","1ff30832a5ee49cf0ec04029fb374acaeb34549e","79b95c3d64deb99b2e3ecd91d55d4f0f1cc99884","9327204ea343e26c495c7f13df60691aee5d1be4","1f48ce60ba605775c201574ef232f2c3615be1a2","6ff753cea6069bd52994ba9c69ba170ab8e05d67","c19333166937fa9a1138f93e79f396223d725eb8","451d66054da51922d904cdb55a52ce394658e934","0b67ae14e43700c5ef9a7d028f33f5f8af74a205","d2e513c9c812ce97c9d138912a3a365fb0b5bdd6","86cab0053d41839a8d29a1934a1fe45e7c1fa2e3","48b8bff3112f02b6d4f30181f1b38d374d18e5d8","20c721c492d54b16c5d92367238b7466893171db","ec1d164061c31cd55eb1c050272443b09352a0ae","a079ae66cad10e863bb463d28d8db53f774682ab","36ac9626f302189a65c04b90e78c7e6d7e14c164","0414b6f6fb8655af7107c1a07907d568ad4b2818","4341d1d9f6312237fa947330c7eceedc01b61e46","089ccbf737a33dce1937202902fdda82855a89b8","369a594bc61e44fa3b59762365188e64b6a36347","0b81ba8b42123a4d207ebea44fdc7718c4a81cb2","0761666a440d4301e3c35ee75c4692a55d0b52ff","48e798751a126e3315e6f99887b05765ebe9d5fa","a04807a71aab893394ca3048d8f3d3c7b237d864"],"pdfUrls":["http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=b63f4fc5a9348e21e01fc7498ecd146b","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=8bdf493705bb9e9d6e8774ed4ee57dd9","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=7d3925604fc6df938d324db6549aaa25","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=23cddd1ec8e561f2540075fa300ac159","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=b5607e9378010d43bf109c0b61131903","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=567cac9c37873176cda3f8899123c3df","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=9cbaf7b18cba0fca62625c95e409cecc","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jck/publications/icse99.pdf","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan/publications/icse-99-submitted.ps","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=8bdf19a781c3fba96a79905c089475e0","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=c628d0a1300761fbd0993387d2f6d715","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=4a979222f37e451b9596daf57f0fd93a","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=809fc65a61cfc3a23e1a9028be20aa62","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=ae8c479134bf15461058cda101aab53c","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=9f4757dda22b164b1b7773df60b675c2","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=d733353178bff9f925ddc0c402052f19","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=1b3b63b4fc392bb567b2a50a593fd2f6","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=cf02cdfed776f227e02d07f18581c625","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=17d63d2bb3bf8407362f5c4508fa9c3d","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=3bca7e4a10a5dd9696596ce0de0f2ba1","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=90afd31c7af153993f5b9a0cfff92742","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/papers/00841008.pdf","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=68029366699d0bad1e902fe0c184ae74","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=af3119ab9733365a49b50cbf54f90e7d","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=24db788cf56a5b730f4324c9c5cc6d45","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=1ed72c6b7c17c783ded3227182a50ce6","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=c30e114114703906e5321a6df9814467","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=aa7623fb3a409c6134b46e5e0e4955b3","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=27b535bf9ffea4750f8f0d329b8193c6","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=156b700fde724796540fda6308615dcc","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=5f84a6975fe3ce5b983eeb8e9fa631f4","http://dependability.cs.virginia.edu/publications/icse99.pdf?PHPSESSID=9eccdde4ccc9b91bff2252fd

It provides tools that are knowledgeable about the process of system construction and evolution and that work in symbiosis with the system builders and evolvers. These tools are integrated around the constructive use of formal module interface specifications. We first discuss the problems that Inscape addresses, outline our research strategies and approaches to solving these problems, and summarize the contributions of the Inscape Environment. We then discuss the major aspects of the Inscape Environment: the specification language, system construction, system evolution, use and reuse, and validation. We illustrate these various components with examples and discussions.","inCitations":["357bf9f3afc6c96d67a2e3b964e76eeac1b2a7bf","76231ba81a8f8357e571314231fd5def1105a0bd","1fa9b0122d983948f73f417cf9ea714d624d8f36","804ce378ddbb3c62e1781494491e5165572f13b4","31fa355d5e8783575975c0f7b4aa57816640106c","0f0c33fdf4c968c16a45b047d948f6d9bc6e8c64","3bf3c7ddb60e05c29e72f23e5f41d39ce541efa0","c6a47ef2999d38df17096e7580cab5ad23714a49","3320ffb3833dffc726d5a83cd5bfe3794220fba4","8055a13714cdb24f29f9e7a8c3f441014d2c9f9b","0226e4347d28d3955649f4883036e91b9c9dcf73","20b80ad54872d68b714beacff7d829eca2e2848a","bb5767f69010e79c67c3a7b637a3ecaca3ea083d","fa355acdd7ff190d021bd00f01d5da7623294fcd","f5f5845fa3b5d257a88e7c82a5b122028db46b53","32b7f0fbc805e1d86175e2c404f55c78a2f61db5","1a6701bb2fa286e917afea1384d26b5fe92eef89","1eddd09012220b0348593bf9e246a225250b4e47","779bdf52da0730ffafdf29195ba20d1134d4594f","4a5343692c982764173e7e4d1ad7a3d5bed39c07","23b2a5f0e7b87b9cec15896aedae8e4bdab143f1","2939505247220e676e9f5d802b697ce2017b0bed","ef2bf852fc3672944c1d96e8ab3f3422e00077ca","1a2e8de88ec1496723f6859583a26905a2868e99","9df193d6d234d0628ee5843670418ba727bdf7e9","f35329951a28cbdcdd0384a577f5524a852c6214","a9f83864bef8b653e5a7f031e27938453545c863","3457426b2f4e4f0ef749acd13c8e88062706a5e5","142a6991c9c49ca966318c481371401527e3f66c","1d40a52c8e639c572980c7c54b90a39d5a19b346","5e48d5695446287b95c6f7748866c562dd00b8bf","806f6e9df323395d4f24a84370b410002d7dd526","3a06a4b1189fd79595a0e50314a82f5f7b4e2487","3f08d38ef5b4c3738faae7f117a3bdfdcc63b1cb","1f671fa7e879f0c007c07955172f370d5edcf3a6","47a044c8b0e8b2cdd9fe1f525acadb3ca0c0e837","aa571e73e9c9ce475de675327e324f2a564f7288","f43d95e1efbb7b1a0ebc9945b24d2a73425773ec","053073820a6e0a9d12f9bec53df9dbd59a8f65f9","47ccbead3b5aabb3300c13a7bcf2f6e5d1d57685","6eb0026f88afcb5427c29178e0483a457241e5b4","f9ffc61def64865176588b36272ca552d55203ea","4e7a5fe3134dd26b3a71de04c9350d2473d715f4","5f457dcd573a7d257327f1ca7bb9c76b2bf30cc7","3c052722b9c0294bde40d9044e60f9102ec318ec","4902e4df3158406f1b782b40e2b923fbe38228c4","6889a2a0168e6e995c72f2111d24b71f0b6d25b9","6afbe2dc0319f6b751493c41efbb89f134709190","9eecc63ef1d07fe1738d745ee920b0eff329427d","96169a2e4b841ead0e3170a84223180cf09be6cd","5342e3484c74f0412bfe14251bf9c32b615b2d0f","298f10800c8587fae2672ffb447ff4d5135ec68a","92355ef4feb75ba66f31c692b8cbe6d8f89c2f2c","2a097ebdbe637b14a2e6bbfe9394b7b648e916a0","ac62079cf7643ec3c5a60f40cfe4c26b49c66087","088bfcf0e465aef402bd02b1a8b3c2efa319146b","9d51e8184d3b7496ce10a21a0a0a6a9c0adc7be1","b5ac919fde5f1f4bb9494c278662a17c85ec4243","0f4b5a954c86bbbf6a3ae56843e8d42cb64e9233","8725acb41b7f188058ba33337d5e0d3b99f807f6","017197e80907c62847ce58745915883902ce0945","9c261e635da3e23547e99aa2aeffcc3dbaea473d","18f650e0d79e55a7cc201a284cc21e129937e3a8","83cc2a437e9e138f0fd280fb6e1218e102c29fdb","4d6a61ce793c16007d452d6c370bbf9b9bdd4187","b4ac4b0a6c7f2a101abe9c42f16e1075537f1cc2","3fd2554c01248ea6faffa8cd235d53f2bd7a67ae","55b30afc41546742582f485fb65ff2b891ea17a1","401a198b7c6fd5824e0c6a0073d58adfb6bf56cd","bc2151af22bfe31f5a8d13062d78b0885de1726d","0e8e30d9df418cd7b0f6e006d1bb0c4a2d5034fd","038c9c05e7777259bde90adcb66f2609285a8f5e","abb807d373211e3d00cf051e0da3c3fdd30af91a","7a33f8a480634f3d98b881d7bb5bc427b0c37e1f","18bf2fb98a33f8ce714a6df33d791f4aaa76be4b","028944e596bbe7fa553bb87286514e0efa1e78fd","741cff98fc4c423c27456f6e04db8a8da629af11","bb647619cf374c8f25847f76bf18f8f07e6f5232","597397c9709a218d480e7c3e0443d8906b2de988","173ce2b6eb8885f42b1ad06018dbdf446e0bb1f2","463243d1ea240c83b39baef2a7427cf01e8b7201","a2ffafd10fcb7afbd8da1a76ef22baa4366f2113","03ffca0954e972aff7482005963f7bcae694e9c4","58925cd47ec01430c3d46e37fa1bc797807a6ec5","7115ec70b7e12c650b803eeb4384725666d4410c","725749f2e92c937250ef92ba3acabe3006e6e536","5ae9347fe6f6dfc6bb38fd7b51f10ec8ec6cdebe","118e713665b9705d7f11d432d74944268a3b8964","e0890d902a48537ca80bf9c7d49cb12fa268e571","7903600f7dcbad670a3eec6f4e540621234c35db","61a0331720808c6e220b831a6718f528dca96f1b","0c69a3b20232b4640267f3a5c528fe4fe451d99a","601f3a801b86fb5c47f76a825c3aa0ecfb456385","a6843ec5c841bcc8d643705c99836b3a36b71697","3591b8cbe4bf0c2d7f4418bc41a3ea8429be8751","561facc50d62f7fd1ae852d4c5d36ef13f5b1bfc","4f78fc7784ed987a90ac77f2d9af6138d547e873","1a0edeb85363420b708929465a5b5ab74098a9c0","c7235d08ca37b1cd17c5ef477725455182e8d13c","5d1520847b22b8f748bf5fdee9b038792fcabfb4"],"pdfUrls":["http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry////work/papers/icse11.pdf","http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~yaoguo/PhDReading07/perry-icse11.pdf","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse11.ps.gz","http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse11.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74588","http://www.cs.utah.edu/~eeide/compilers/old/papers/icse89-perry.pdf","http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/work/papers/icse11.pdf"],"title":"The Inscape Environment","doi":"10.1145/74587.74588","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74588","venue":"ICSE"}

Those using entity relationship modeling or deriving from it employ the concept of relations between entities, but identifying the relations is still more of an art than science or engineering. We deal with this problem primarily in the context of object oriented analysis (OOA), where relations between object classes are to be identified. Our new approach uses natural language definitions of object classes and looks for names of other object classes in these definitions, since such a reference indicates a relation. Based on this idea, we identify most binary relations for domain models in a new way. We also provide tool support for this method, which shows that a high degree of automation is possible. Both a case study using the well known ATM (automated teller machine) example and real world experience with our approach suggest its usefulness.","inCitations":["01e2772d79ec9bded0536606ecb72baf4a09d86d","ab787f2129166126fb9a3acad4ac245ed2ffff29","b51814c63644bdec82823078015b993531c77cd4","17479113334c62ea6c8ffbc43a6010504f2ea6c8","5f9ec124bf9f1fafd1f8cdf9f7fbf3241caa0373","29362f792794f4e946135e20ebab3d6c7d175d60","9bb8174abc08c3609f4b8d4a5574f200d36645da","a6dac9a34e010e13e3f0ff76bbfcbfb4e6281474","eae6c1a1d6f2c6af36163f73e6eb78f3386d630b","f725e8c026e11b3560cefcdee135425cfb096682","c3a41db4ff428c86f5ac34e83709a59b9c34c753","850d9557334d994c88e8e0bfcacd180e3cdd5beb","7b1c3b4cbcc119c24f8d66b80bf4abecf92aff39"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=227726.227734"],"title":"How to Identify Binary Relations for Domain Models","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

We describe how we developed an initial object-oriented requirements model for an existing missile planning system. We adopted two approaches: a bottom-up approach in which we constructed objectoriented model fragments that corresponded to segments of the requirements documents, and a top-down approach that was driven by the construction and analysis of scenarios. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of the example.","inCitations":["868611cf9692081bb1e768b0fef7c022ca0b1e1f","08f8b71e76eefa7a377479e04bf0be9f26a4684f","421658316d09b8d2e5c1250f2fa0dbccb51392da","335a5b5f71d036a3585e580be0eda209c442eac1","0bec3f35515e680e779c2fa81fb884231234460a","0e2c5b44ccac92bf4abd82c79ff94be1239d471d","f39dd14faec2782c7043a295c3593e5fe2d8d74a","a6dac9a34e010e13e3f0ff76bbfcbfb4e6281474","41a54935166026cfd5f3d9bf525a2ed01f7c6228","c2cad077d5f5f8fa7e4089f6d70e5d1f7234f0ec","18c4887c5ddc78c907d99b70b2181bad4b98c640","42789320c8de9a46dc15974bada53c748805af34","5e39ec483201668880c17c8b59a327774de58850","2d0d4b08d58b39b6421cd673b3bfe5aa94bfda16","ff89d7be8cbcbdf90be2cead3678226ba7facd93","468b3218ecf9d2456c3b4a960c9dc0fdeb5b5109","7457239b4e1e3199c716e1898e437f1b9167b2b9","a9bda4414206784c30cfcd3a8a2b637adb9c2a0f"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257572.257629"],"title":"Developing Initial OOA Models","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Most current work on multithreaded Java program verification assumes a model of execution that is based on interleaving of the operations of the individual threads. However, the Java language specification (which any implementations of Java multithreading must follow) supports a weaker model of execution, called the Java Memory Model (JMM). The JMM allows certain reordering of operations within a thread and thus permits more behaviors than the interleaving based execution model. Therefore, programs verified by assuming interleaved thread execution may not behave correctly for certain Java multithreading implementations.The main difficulty with the JMM is that it is informally described in an abstract rule-based declarative style, which is unsuitable for formal verification. In this paper, we develop an equivalent formal executable specification of the JMM. Our specification is operational and uses guarded commands. We then use this executable model to verify popular software construction idioms (commonly used program fragments/patterns) for multithreaded Java. Our prototype verifier tool detects a bug in the widely used \"Double-Checked Locking\" idiom, which verifiers based on interleaving execution model cannot possibly detect.","inCitations":["078fb7ef15137e56554a5485c5ab57ae28192447","98bae5084a1c05780daeb9cfd09afe9e085c51a4","03dec12760fa085b513f510913a737d8c2a90561","748385227e9dbe4f6444573f66a7b618df644de9","aeebf22bba2b8e34d9becde45d389ceb6d3ab0b8","bab9b618e2e73760c533092ddae6e01b8a8b3b76","523a82ea1ff41a9544d8ade6f6322be95d25948e","d374204dbed9114bef4c7e29e63e37da89cdb456","e62069e653194048bbd3998f7cc57cad5d5ca95a","f7f14eab6af54e58420cefca35579aef73241f42","0ed16859ec6e047f6b9aa29dde6ad5cf991c55d9","215eeef55161d841457584772fe8dc71e29d786f","38f9632aa97de91c7631d782efff5add3b9e122a","1b6543c4a91ff45913a884f50a0e02673bdabb59","7181bad24c62cc7eaa030e10e3a7e4049934b0cb","3dd98bc07769dc7103a4d2bd59578fa107504813","0bea67c87e186e3b1bd06505c17e6b771174dd96","1eaf94958dd775305feb632559760a411d2ef809","39bddd161ba2e720a4c6b78fbeabb59bb7ce83b2","80ac34bc8d88455ebcab82d2b4c3604554e46092","88d4bcbea19a9308608d8b5677a2eb574fde1449","a0781bfe5c32c6239657f9afe3c209c877090488","164bde3a4e00834ab7b3a60c18c869aea19f628e","4e8cdb6eff7c7e6ba957fafabeeb45e7cfc44171","2dcd325fd408d961b8176ce1217ae7095df7f612","1af0251eb32a8b7d8797c7012eefa3a9db09a990","2a209562ea060f0f803d5ae05e7bb06977adf008","2cc63859ef826f85f191fabed5e9c1126f307c3a","06dfabcf4e4b2f5887b404a8776ca6609fb4a44c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.people.vcu.edu/~bmurrill/courses/csc625/roychoudhury02.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/pdf/icse02.pdf","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~abhik/ps/icse02.ps","http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/icse02.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581399"],"title":"Specifying multithreaded Java semantics for program verification","doi":"10.1145/581339.581399","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581399","venue":"ICSE"}

We present a conceptual model for addressing new design issues these components afford, and we identify fundamental design decisions in this model that are not a concern in conventional object-oriented design. We use JavaBeans-based examples to illustrate concretely how expertise in component-based design, as embodied in a component taxonomy and implementation space, impacts both design and the process of design. The results are not exclusive to JavaBeans—they can apply to any comparable component architecture.","inCitations":["8c6c33f178e0c9774892d0cd26562b375190e8a7","6fcccd6def46a4dd50f85df4d4c011bd9f1855af","9552da05f2852637a4dbf114ba51649a856103f2","5f9d5a4c75d53a8c3a81ef1fb3c27efd8b9eceea","086a4d2038d07f1b6f26d48a6607ce01ecbfede2","f7a9cf34b3a865bfb125ddf7a134802051cb9f16","381b59bf4d71f5b4dfa08bb8935d1545e8b45e39","8705603e7a374eadb9b93dd536ee2446fb28d4dd","5c317218fb04e611c047ae32373b72ec75f2e6b0","beb092f9fdb8e003b22bc53d113606af205136ed","2cae0f8d98643f07662bea43094227d5a6c8f315","99ef7a54d50ff876c04d88df9b02871c099db16b","61a1fc19ba3402648ad06da2b6e695d320ba9645","496e37dbfab5cced88f364c5af2869c0d86e645f","fdb08aff1483b353594fd138ac02458147fd7776","30f7e71a712b9792a86f30f1e5ab153ce91f9ba1","946bc4c964200b49c0e47297a0d727cdd27cd9b2","14247e498c47b5a7c8d9390ac910e9b4f563463d"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919099","http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~maurer/CSI5v93CLP/Papers/Designing%20Components%20VS%20Objects.pdf","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lorenz/papers/icse01/icse2001.ps.gz","http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lorenz/papers/icse01/icse2001.ps.gz"],"title":"Designing Components Versus Objects: A Transformational Approach","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919099","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919099","venue":"ICSE"}

It aims at presenting the state-of the art in this field and the problems and chal I eoges set by the demonstration nf the 5afet.y o.f ,these systems. The utilization of computer systems in cr-iti.cal sectors raises the crucial problem of sof t.ware safety . Two approaches to design are applied at industrial level : -the design of N-Versions __ a rigorous and methodological approach aiming at the a.voidance of software errors and theitreduction t.o as near zero as possible. The comparison of these methods, which cor>cernEj performance as much a P economy, must overcome the problem of a 1 a c I? 0 f pub1 ished recju 1 ts obtai.ned through the USE! of these methods. Between 1.5’80 and 1984 MERLlN GE:RIN developed t.he first nuclear power station programmed protection system (SPTN) > for the french 13(30 MW (P4 series) power stations. This system is based on order 4 hardware redundancy and on the philosophy of Fjoftware fault avoidance. The main t.ask of WIN is to t.rigger an emergency shutdown in the power station by monitoring the reactor core operating parameters and to trigger a certain number of safety measures. The hiyh safety requirements are matched I however, by availability conditions, since unscheduled shutdowns in power stations are extremely costly and frequent shutdowns disturb ,the running of the core. The software took 13 ) 400 hours of development time and consists of 40,000 lines of assembler h800 code. During 5 years of use at 23 sites and after 9 successive software versions;, _ minor software Not a single lncldent due t: errors have been detected. the hardware has been observed. These results have been obtained by applyiny a strict methndology based on three major points : .The strict. application of a life CYClI, with clearly defined steps and the producti.an of qua1 if ied documents at each step3 the setting ctp of a verification/ qualification team which is independent from the design team b and who are responsible for the verification and qua1 if ication of the documents produced at each step before authorization is yiven for progression to the next, the elaboration of design and programming rules and recommandations whose putpose i. 5 to eliminate hazardous I over-complicated or insufficiently legible constructions. Since 1986, MERLIN GERIN have been developing a new genera.tion of the SPIN system for 1500 MW (N4 series) power s.tations which corresponds to a technological development based essentially on the use of local network% and a siqnificant expansion of t.he software. 0270-5257/90/0000/0225/t01.00 Q1990lEEE 225 Faced with this growing compJ.exity the ef f icriency of the fault avoidance methodology can be brought into question . This methodology is based on the capacity 0 .f a human being to : discipline himself to observe the formalized design procedures to produce documents during design and to check. the design constantly, including aft.er each modification. If it ~3.5 possible to trust a small group of people to respect these constraint.5 and that it was actually possible to check thei.r work effi.ciently for SPIN P4, i.t. is doubtful that the same applies i n the new context. For this reasnn Y MERLIN GEKIN is equipped with the SAGA software tool, intended to impt-ove this approach to f au1 t avoidance. This t.ool) developed by MERLIN GERIN, rjupports the specificati.on, design and code generatinn phases. Its main characteristics are : -the tool comprises restrictions which cannot be overridden by the designer (it is impossible t0 proceed to the next step un 1 ess everything has been doctsmen%ed and declared I9 the too1 makes consistency checks ( in t.erf ace consistency P initialization consistency I memory consistency (t.Ise of updating value or previous value.. . 1) r -the t.ool aLrtc!matically updates the docamentation, -. the tool lead5 towards the defini.tion otuse of si.mpJ.e f!.rnctions or operators which are pragt-ammed in Cr by a process 0 f s~.~cc:ess~ve raf inementc,.

With the SFIN N4 series, it would seem that WP have reached the li.mits of the pure fault avoidance phi.losophy and that confidence in future systems will require the LlS!T?? of supplementary too15 and methods i n order to improve the certification process. It is clear that the approach adopted for the software will present questions in the future : -” how to place the Design Team/Checking Team approach in relation to the design of N-versions ? Due to the increasing complexity, t.he cost of verification is rising, causing this first approach to lose some of its ecnnomic benefits . From another angle, the second approach, i n our field, clashes with problems of common specifications. -. The problem of reliability quanti.fication remains unanswered . we have tried to apply the reliability growth models (Mu!% I Littlewood) to developments which have a 1 ready been produced : because of the low number of errors encountered during execution 1 once the aberrant elements have been eliminated, the extrapolation from t.he error readings perplexing, D .f rom another angle, it is insatisfactory to rjupply a safety estimate based on hardware failures and on the “zero-fault” hypothesis. -” The formal approach seems promising : it mirst be possible, using formal specifications, to derive, throughout the design process, simple properties that the program must check in order to mai.ntain safety. In this manner, ii i 5 hoped that the safety of the program can be prnved without. having to formally prove the whole of the program. Finally, I will conclude by saying that the experimental approach used now seems solid, a5 long as their application is aided by automated tools. In future it seems that L,%e will have to be made of thecrretical r:ontributi.ons.","inCitations":["772fa559b017c90254dd63db264c07e0ac980bde","cba18d8e2acac50b06323e6143721519c820239e"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=100328"],"title":"Some Experiences of Critical Software Development","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

However, there has been a growing sentiment in many quarters that there are some concerns that stubbornly resist tidy confinement, when using established modularization mechanisms in programming languages. A diverse set of new approaches have emerged in response: aspects [1], monads [5], mixin layers [3], and multi-dimensional separation of concerns [4]. These approaches arose more or less independently of each other, and have (to varying degrees) developed technical maturity, real-world credibility and strong user bases. We are also now beginning to see strong scholarly comparisions of the intellectual foundations and practical utility of these different aproaches. This panel aims to support this trend. In this panel, we bring together leading experts (Profs. Batory, Kiczales, and Launchbury, and Dr. Tarr) in these different areas. Each represents a particular perspective on how to evolve and adapt the old idea of modularization to deal with new challenges such as security, fault-tolerance, distribution, and auditing. In addition, we also have two pioneering researchers (Profs. Balzer and Parnas) to provide us with a historical perspective on the evolution (sic) of program modularization and evolution techniques.

With the increasing adoption of reuse methods and technologies, this question becomes critical. However, directly tracking the actual cost savings due to reuse is difficult. A worthy goal would be to develop a method of measuring the savings indirectly by analyzing the code for reuse of components. The focus of the paper is to evaluate how well several published software reuse metrics measure the \"time, money and quality\" benefits of software reuse. We conduct this evaluation both analytically and empirically. On the analytic front, we introduce some properties that should arguably hold of any measure of \"time, money and quality\" benefit due to reuse. We assess several existing software reuse metrics using these properties. Empirically, we constructed a toolset (using GEN+S) to gather data on all published reuse metrics from CS+ code; then, using some productivity and quality data from \"nearly replicated\" student projects at the University of Maryland, we evaluate the relationship between the known metrics and the process data. Our empirical study sheds some light on the applicability of our different analytic properties, and has raised some practical issues to be addressed as we undertake broader study of reuse metrics in industrial projects.","inCitations":["2a314a67a1e224119d88b6f91cebe5874d94b635","a2f969e8afcb068b8c651acc51d446108ac12aeb","4dfb6a7d358b8bc5cd08ced55ac37f7215575046","e59bdd92aa3f8ecb121d4d5034a17a0858ce3bf8","2caac78d78fba3767055baaa1f0c0230dcc3951a","1a88272f8184edfafd8c53cb5e30b424efe4fdf5","6b3436d1626970915f690294970b61aa214ba136","3701b379496fc231342594e41012af6475180fe4","d1ae5214b90b763b9e3e8560d7ee3bdc257c0e84","1ecfcc9bf20e523820ab6b874b972d5b2b562edf","a8988267a92631a3d98532d2f5b928b1ca34f8b4","3b145cd79eb769b3a832037946367eb3b4ad8ded","6c2575e9e0fa39d07e05ba52ec55f5ca06beea51","bac700ed8af386f83c97a899e2698aefd2afde76","c8938137d4a25564f02929ee115ef60777441c44","394eb7c49d22834d646af2ce73d4bc622a158d8c","cc46a8ba591880c791cb3425e94a2d6f614ba016","8eefcb4c125c0fcefc5454256ec08aab601646fd","9251c33abc5a89a3144475f60fb74fb1c2ccc72f","25d50c6c34c58fe161e269aaeb70cb0b99c1cd52","3b76465acecba3951c55e8637786deb0c8f77083","3ac86615e29aebf385e261ba5e18e39863310102","7f89ca603f7200f4cac4b8ac081c7d6ac40046de","e4f4026c109aefa61c8aefe5efdacd6ad44f9c6f","98dfdbc0f9e9a0f13f142e83bfadae3954d4bbed","10f09ef5b3a5daf46f7bc0a80ce2d6babf9beae8","d34afa82ef89bdd15165f29f7629c19673437953","500adbb1aa85b6b0b2fdd4900bea2c1b37976fce","aecc1a77946f80d2c216ef45e54d1eea753bb69a","52de7e6bee0dcfd35369f51c8a89590c55bee24d","05382d442d5fb1ea62bf9240fd002648bdafd198","7275fdf8438c89bd4c44e771980907edc439d395","c320513e3d2a39da9712052770e4dbbf5ec230d4","a231d9ff304d0c155af892054393faa9b64e6cd2","cdaa8460737a02b88b4c2a7021c10522b4080043","2306f29ed87bb1b12ae2768bf10fd72d4c821abc","129a61b59e202a734a3776e97305baeb37c9cd0f","372e5428edff1998cc2036d1d8ac7a7e9d86de65","7c27f2bf5ab18c8e696b28eaf66dcde5d6976147","0ea97778edf598cd5fc0e9cd5b47732fed587fbf","f927fb545c60a5863888811f8c70c6f9a72b8967","88d61d8fa962ff0486fc1c179eeea43f9ad1be5a","92c33b8e0834e4b2f4a704c0f19ba1c917138675","7153733cb98d3da35d5bc59a31c44c193825aec1","c9d8b4976096d3b7c1fd78b0143f092ae11d1e51","1ecc545c213606d9b0b16f06d988544211b01f80","58c4edc75e92eae076ae1ac5755f2d4017c5a08c","69f0c7a1877d70727f6e0bf3e187bac5232d6a4a","b2a6534c99bd12988cd6197dd6b414bce53980e6","0111be2075bd619fe10db243e247e33acdd43407","3ff1be881f39156d84d178ab7f82437d346eb05c","0519d73c2dfc11a6a785dc360c050f7774ec476d","28e2e250f7e4cd28e9e30fda33e400fc94ea931f","d415ad8f13bc2d24a2f2931e7bb96e9d07c32394","72dfb8219eba1c4f1c2cbf90c95c42d507bae6b7","08ae3f221339feb8230ae15647df51e7a5b5a13a","67a30469c386314df2acfcdba2d929533f21ee35","b67798bb31fb267b0109b7bad4648b77f0c0bc67","67edb9b8003c5ad1197a29b6ccd85fd17c775df1","0432adf3dd5f6ed980dbb013c007ecb700850e0e","13b83611794dd5c2b13698205d7bb78d790c765c","b5098ff690290e14e11518709c61d0b0d98127ef","3d4460e875e3abbd88fe6468f406c4b8b4a97b1c","51e2b9e82e0d029f57d2bb4ce5005f440f744c1f","d2707ffde54820ee22b5e9bb230c073ce9efffc7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/icse96.ps.gz","http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/749/CS-TR-3505.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=4","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=227726.227760","http://www.geocities.com/walcelio_melo/cs-tr-3505.pdf","ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/papers/papers/ncstrl.umcp/CS-TR-3505/CS-TR-3505.ps.Z"],"title":"Analytical and Empirical Evaluation of Software Reuse Metrics","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

App developers spend considerable effort on collecting and exploiting user feedback to improve user satisfaction, but suffer from the absence of effective user review analytics tools. To facilitate mobile app developers discover the most “informative” user reviews from a large and rapidly increasing pool of user reviews, we present “AR-Miner” — a novel computational framework for App Review Mining, which performs comprehensive analytics from raw user reviews by (i) first extracting informative user reviews by filtering noisy and irrelevant ones, (ii) then grouping the informative reviews automatically using topic modeling, (iii) further prioritizing the informative reviews by an effective review ranking scheme, (iv) and finally presenting the groups of most “informative” reviews via an intuitive visualization approach. We conduct extensive experiments and case studies on four popular Android apps to evaluate AR-Miner, from which the encouraging results indicate that AR-Miner is effective, efficient and promising for

It is shown that constants as well as rules and regulations typically found in business applications should be factored out and stored separately from the application programs in a data base. Definitional equations are proposed as a method for specifying such rules and regulations. The equations can be used as parameters to various types of interpreters to be used by application programs.\n As an illustration of the methodology, one such interpreter has been implemented. This paper shows its application to a screen handling program; other uses are discussed. The interpreter and its implementation are outlined.","inCitations":["bd506dd13cb2cb235a9f59d3e152facad7b73171","6e35d21a46b1aad83c76b9843183e65375354f7b","a28686e7453cf1652ee14a79355ec7f971f54574"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807779","http://user.it.uu.se/~torer/publ/p367-lucas.pdf"],"title":"Representation of Factual Information by Equations and Their Evaluation","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Ii has previously been shown that the fact that cm”terion Cl subsumes criterion C2, does not guarantee that Cl is better at detecting faults than C2. However if a certain stronger relation between the criteria holds, then for any program and any specification, Cl is guaranteed to be better at detecting faults than C2 in the following sense; a test suite selected by ~nde pendent random selection of one test case from each Cl subdomain is at least as likely to detect a fault as a test suite similarly selected using C2.

SDL is based on a model in which processes use powerful transactions to manipulate abstract views of a virtual, content-addressable data structure called the dataspace. The process society is dynamic and supports varying degrees of process anonymity. The transactions are executed over abstract views of the dataspace. This facilitates elegant conceptualization of dataspace transformations and compact program representation. Processes and transactions enable SDL to combine elements of both large and fine grained concurrency. The view is a novel abstraction mechanism whose significance is derived from the fact that it allows processes to interrogate the dataspace at a level of abstraction convenient for the task they are pursuing. The view also plays a role in the definition of continuously updated, programmer-defined visual abstractions which enable exploration of the program's functionality and performance.","inCitations":["f11f75b2e0661e4b73c28534523f184005654437","3427a754d4969257b2b1e19d97f9c2b251aea414","57fc9a380178b4c36b906005519c16556bbf9e95","a5eed16b5fef1da368ae0d5603f48a8c239ee9e3"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=55853"],"title":"Language and Visualization Support for Large-Scale Concurrency","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Investigations such as software lifecycle modeling efforts have attempted to help us understand the nature of these processes by identifying major subactivities, subproducts and information flows. Work on software environments has, in the past, emphasized the integration of tools, but has all too often not addressed the issue of how these integrated tools support software processes. Fortunately there is an increasing realization that such process support is the goal of software environments, and more recent environments are addressing that goal more sharpl.\n In this panel we shall attempt to review some notable and influential tool integration and environment development efforts from this more contemporary perspective in an attempt to perceive current trends and directions more clearly and to more sharply identify the key contributions which this work has made. As an aid to setting this tone and perspective for the panel, we shall begin with a presentation by Nelson Weiderman, for the Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Dr. Weiderman will summarize a paper which he coauthored with A. N. Habermann, M.W. Borger and M.H. Klein in which they suggest that environments should be evaluated in precisely this way. Their paper details a flow of methodological steps for evaluation of toolsets and environments which stresses that such systems should be measured against a clear enunciation of the software activities which the tools and environments are purported to support. The paper goes on to describe how dynamic testing of subject toolsets should be organized to gain quantitative insights into the effectiveness of the subject systems in supporting the identified processes.\nThe significance of this evaluative approach is at least twofold. First it forces environment developers to recognize that the key result of their work is support of processes, and second it forces all of us as a community to realize that we must increasingly work to understand the set of activities which comprise software processes and software objects which comprise our products. These realizations will help lead us to the more effective environments of the coming decade.\n After Dr. Weiderman's opening presentation there will be six subsequent presentations of current and recent work. These presentations have been carefully selected to represent a variety of approaches to providing support for a variety of client communities in a variety of locations. Each presenter has been asked to consider the way in which his system supports a particular process or subactivities of a process; any architectural features which distinguish or characterize his system; how effective he believes his system has been in conveying support for the portion of the process which has been identified; and whether the architectural approach taken has or has not been particularly useful in helping to achieve the process support goals for the system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=41793"],"title":"Lessons of Current Environments","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

As all these activities mean initial investment compared to a standard process with scattered activities, the major validation criteria for the 3 hypotheses is cost reduction due to earlier defect detection and less defects introduced.

From its roots in qualitative descriptions of useful system organizations, software architecture has matured to encompass broad explorations of notations, tools, and analysis techniques. Whereas initially the research area interpreted software practice, it now offers concrete guidance for complex software design and development.\nWe can understand the evolution and prospects of software architecture research by examining the research paradigms used to establish its results. These are, for the most part, the paradigms of software engineering. We advance our fundamental understanding by posing research questions of several kinds and applying appropriate research techniques, which differ from one type of problem to another, yield correspondingly different kinds of results, and require different methods of validation. Unfortunately, these paradigms are not recognized explicitly and are often not carried out correctly; indeed not all are consistently accepted as valid.\nThis retrospective on a decade-plus of software architecture research examines the maturation of the software architecture research area by tracing the types of research questions and techniques used at various stages. We will see how early qualitative results set the stage for later precision, formality, and automation and how results build up over time. This generates advice to the field and projections about future impact.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://spoke.compose.cs.cmu.edu/ser01/IC-1026/icse-key-rev.pdf","http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/~hcc/researchMethods/13spr/notes/localcopy/Shaw_ComingOfAge_keynote_rev.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/shaw-keynote-rev.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/vit/ftp/pdf/shaw-keynote-rev.pdf","http://www.eng.auburn.edu/csse/classes/comp7700/papers/The_Coming-of-Age_of_Software_Architecture_Research.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919142","http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/~hcc/researchMethods/notes/localcopy/Shaw_ComingOfAge_keynote_rev.pdf","https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/2001/1050/00/10500656.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/vit/ftp/pdf/shaw-keynote-rev.pdf","http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/resch-writing-tut-3.pdf","http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/~hcc/researchMethods/14spr/notes/localcopy/Shaw_ComingOfAge_keynote_rev.pdf"],"title":"The Coming-of-Age of Software Architecture Research","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919142","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919142","venue":"ICSE"}

They are cross-cutting requirements, or aspects. Their support is, by necessity, scattered across those multiple classes. A look at an individual class may also show support for cross-cutting requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class. Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to understand, extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits, those benefits are reduced when cross-cutting requirements are present. This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating the design of cross-cutting requirements into composition patterns. Composition patterns require extensions to the UML, and are based on a combination of the subject-oriented model for composing separate, overlapping designs, and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for separation of cross-cutting requirements in code—aspect-oriented programming.

Such methodologies attempt to usefully support the programmer's thought process for re-creating only good, standard patterns of programming without limiting creativity. However methodologies, as they are generally used, are limited in their impact on software quality. In this paper we present an approach for human engineering methodologies based on forms. The advantages of using a form-based interface for a software engineering environment are discussed by focusing on the design of forms, on the impact of forms on the software engineering process, and on the improved tool support facilitated by the standardization achieved by forms.","inCitations":["bd30b65e2bd983440717957d0b14e0dad4ce5836","72d18ddf1ce5ae39a08a40eaf7cc5b0a9845ca69","78fb1bbc0c69f505db14ef99d73e3db22b5e654a","f92d1c98cd33927de84954d9104e6ffe21e52e0e","400c9b9e3688c6fc7f1d338e11a5b8485d13bef7","4759f92d76094dac9abe106f3928b1578ec5671c"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807768"],"title":"A Form-Based Approach to Human Engineering Methodologies","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

For example, cases are now emerging of organizations just doing occasional unit-testing or avoiding documentation, and calling it \"XP.\" What are the skillful means and capabilities required to really help these new process ideas be adopted and succeed?

Yet these strata are not well-defined in either research or practice, causing miscommunication and needless debate.To remedy this problem we formalize the Intension and the Locality criteria, which imply that the distinction between architecture, design, and implementation is qualitative and not merely quantitative. We demonstrate that architectural styles are intensional and non-local; that design patterns are intensional and local; and that implementations are extensional and local.","inCitations":["567e9380b0dbf1037b4578379006fd0a88838b43","4a3f353b4eeedf48e2f6691215d8b58ad6ae9071","75968fe32e34a4a9e8a35fbc7e9931727eb3692e","259fba6c7c6609b292a0f19c8ac246de1d564e2a","d6926faed1d74c8f2b96688bb1a9f8ea3c97b704","2d8e0f376510878082f4db5a32da513fdf0fe73d","bb50370398228adaee59f4d1946779c1a3380170","185cbb9156aa561f66bad73aa6b51c8f001dfab6","b7c32667fe7daa163dacca4d4d75c1a0fe37ab5d","7b7cd60eba09453b2a2e90d3426a81ca56273b80","00c72dd617adce5d8ee89a5bb267d515db25d156","35db34aff2b428db8a8195db78ae52a70b079b70","36f8764691a119024b9a001492dab150df904384","654e25df15ac5cbf77a11e5cd33815a9cc83fec0","ba50099e927c93f918dc1c986bc3ae0c3f45bbc5","fae9f003d9fea4ea490cc75851f8f50b9f575dfe","eff718d8988c66b7c6bf2c65b776f96ef964936f","1d45968bbe9c4b2f5c1fafa0cfde999fd4fcee20","7875c583efd79ab920ec6cb5eedaa41dfeb8c950","7fa2d135f0687d2957bb8a4c6dd0583fea2c329a","28a7f265983a85171f0708878c88c5cb7ee260b7","b7a6a87f5ca41f300d9169bd01df378cf5a246e9","c9bcb9c03a45ffc7fb4c7555a0448f4e89eb720a","98d0443763cebc971aa9fa9997751044ca3242f4","2d1ac1b04366ae1f76811ac10d927de61d9fe20d","91d30551bb6936d5140d658d06c9f5a0b9082682","7b010f7d42c6c2ad050fbb5bc4dece19becda9f1","288af7ef070e297caaa85e50c1db496ce9e5a015","e09c6e7527cec34d32227d32f40337b23d811b9b","5d3c39bef4545224265e35cb882cdb7eeadf2435","0a5590d9f4baa6450f75beae0ce4c70c71831967","975fb976623a3cdbec832fd75a28053aa763caa0","05f9b85e9eefccf418eb8e765ca9a046eee5ee1b","3b969cb080137c9383609e2791ea61caf006692e","5ba30f6f9296ef04dc0e11248e8656a4cd4c6f13","a1b2b48cc615d4b8c33115e87f3c43341c791829","a60183a4a59578909b3ee0c00ae165b96fd09f87","5677018d030bcffe961669ca16c8c4baf4cee4f9","8423d10878f03d4f5d3d465c99f688b13b35331d","caf5d62e288960718a1599db0bd707761173f853","0824a2f0b036d40ba7ef0c7598a499fb25f22e82","71e08f1be887f88e3efbef0430ebb1ddd45bcb0e","f24b52330d5eae54fc5a23798bfe779140f68666","8c14b0024999bed10da0c75c0a05bd222da74f9a","1a2d2f69d6e375470b6cec7543992d7eaee53a9c","73278ce68439d63b6f40df11b7e7bd8a71e91949","4600415bfebeb07142b5116e6da1295ad954a489","b2cda0f8ccb76431cf3d3a96aa454647e9b23b08","cb17a48ed0cd6f085a897a462e69ece5f68dbe59","9b5f570e0b3dbf70e6092ff98fe550a04be8e5f0","47b86c305aefabc59fb81e375b6d21635a770a55","3301428eff3a38bbb491e78e27b66499e5ad4c9f","9d07ef02c1170991af9a2c956bc2c8856e2b6892"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.eden-study.org/articles/2003/icse03.pdf","http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/WhitePaper/2003_019_001_29559.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776835","https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/WhitePaper/2003_019_001_29559.pdf","http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/ICSE03-1.pdf","http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/icse03-1.pdf"],"title":"Architecture, Design, Implementation","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

In order to enact a software process in a distributed environment, the engineers must communicate each other for exchanging data values and synchronization messages. Such communications should be described in a process descm”p tion for enacting the process automatically and clarifying the engineers’ work. Since these communications are numerous, it is troublesome for the process designers to describe them minutely in the process description. They also make the description unreadable. In this paper, we propose a formal soflware process model where we describe only a whole description of a process in which we describe only the contents and temporal orders of primitive activities, and do not specify the communications. From the whole description, we derive each engineer 9s individual description automatically where the contents and orders of his activities and communications to others are described. A whole process is enacted by executing all individual descriptions in parallel. Both whole and individual descriptions are described in LO TOS/SPD, an eztension of the formal specification language LOTOS. We have also developed a support system for deriving the individual descriptions and executing them on UNIX machines.","inCitations":["b7d1093a81dfa1ef7979f15cbbee27bb7046d62c","34d6cc304c214efc15185773b35bb927cb2de1f3","815e8aa148b02a1fd440d3fe48d9369399a39945","b17ba95b6b35cec137b76356c771a2321fef2f18","da786685e745b364d569ccd69c1fddbc7a8af0d7","8c370092c35b6c557966d2324289b198c55d742e","d129c76b3a3c62f9f173f9eec2132e758fb1a554","4f9d144749cb5230b831c0220e2ac1f667b0e1d8"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257758","http://www-tani.ics.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/yasumoto.ref/ICSE16.ps.gz"],"title":"Software Process Description Using LOTOS and Its Enaction","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Events have semantics whereas source lines used by most debuggers do not have any. A trace is a sequence of events. It can be seen as an ordered relation in a database. Users can specify precisely which events they want to see by specifying values for event attributes. At each event, visible variables can be queried. The trace query language is Prolog with a handful of primitives. The trace query mechanism searches through the execution traces using both control flow and data whereas debuggers usually search according to either control flow or data. As opposed to fully “relational” debuggers which use plain database querying mechanisms, Coca trace querying mechanism does not require any storage. The analysis is done on the fly, synchronously with the traced execution. Coca is therefore more powerful than “source line” debuggers and more efficient than relational debuggers.","inCitations":["0ccab4eb36980f62f305be7ad3eb21d86c907aec","66b793ca8a6c01e08a66f11c5cfa9087592c07c5","75d0f64ebe4fe7b8b99744fa5cc2a023d4a9e26b","4843a9ac93ead3601c447d3542acff6f151207e5","55528531620c5d30ac5a38fc0dee321fa3cb8ab6","bfc9e18abdc235a3eb0b865790c2d34f339d60b0","04b39c33d7f87b3920c9f94a2b1587f3b3f3bef4","06b1c5905ce375a4dad2045873a8794cb603e996","13120e3d0c16e926030ec8f291e03c84fbe6ca71","48847b006b86c0196e13b5affac42213b419b21c","c15a2cb7d77178b3e70464aedb0bc0e874985807","966d2e59f12217230ef8f94e058297d3d475fe9f","51b698d725b928c74cacfd421dfdd3eb45b5dbd9","0226029c2e630e94c89d35b2c410e76ce01efd81","3cda291e15ba4de9fc6158cc0ab02216c29336ab","fe77559e580ca1b6228445a15df9fd2c5719f3fd","9896514722d170a0b58a0a4ecf88815bed079fe4","8ccf68f3ad51fba4406ed97af65efa6951f35132","2160b5a0640cbf7cbdd7cc706fe43f0f804b3761","34d0a8589e759554d9b447ec1721c9725c54151a","8f43201b286a03debed4d16df99ac405ee002faf","999c948dca7cb2c4722759693978aebc5d85060f","9ed81914865205b05501c16e48e3c795062545c3","77f581ea19b3598a87d0302cf006dc1ac51b5213","2b3bd5bdf34dca27838e5356a76938bb812a9577","72aba11d4359d395d2c4b5d64f69be40f9c53317","c0af2b648a803c5877cee07e1e24317fd6231057","38b76858748a8c2c72251743858142d64ecf7882","2a672e8d25aa6edd3bc76876b75e4fdd57edf41c","6ebbd4fecd8804614c04b109a7be8f9d42fda5cd","743a31efa6ade80bd119aed58dd5a88847bb76cd","ad854ed19f75be0886e35304fe101065ec8b3b20","c0d0605c21fc0573cafbc06e697ca2c949a421d8","7ce0f688f24702860f72ad75c12bb054188e5bef","261a304226ea44c329202bf58bb21176abb7e23a","263863ad7cff336f4c1f2a6817d8084d50de9484","5c4c7cc2ad32bc8d077a15c686c82d0ae40ca15a","0f95ff262ff71a678e979211842381b057cd4e1a","d1f0c84ed8dd331f04e76fe4a03902629702b06a","02c727a70e687cea807b7ce5c95b79f1ceece625","876530d92061ce09c1462a0349ffdcc259b87d54","06df724e918830ea6e06e53907185c28f0d66cd4","0747ee9c31ebbb47d2b69ea7d517a36adca3de13","0b77b648bb1cf1d94ca987978707337ecfb73985","87bee4d4becd0803e97c6acfd20fa09b9207c871","eb2f41c7d3a7f9b943ff29064c9471902fe6d400","042b481ef9e5f86af6c5cc481ce804bf4cbad701","167c2719068130cb3a6efb789a3db7f2a11d1bd9","74dd140fc3763f348ead0e4625827f5b58223505","47e836a14957c6270d5b8a74abcf56695492789e","c3c93840f62ea3db793ba364bdc093c09e949172","a8e893c5ba3e85eba1f2d539f58aebfcd6cb8406","6ba25a7a2643043909c4223ae7f6b920f2a2e94a","6361b22bea82bb6e5b853c4075fcd1fb43c744f9","0144656699df6ae57325222b4a2a891642fa36e5","f335082d852488fa553e1b4ce8f2353179e9e392","716e69b63871904d4b4c93c7b612f165b5e582e9","2370e52a21d4fd8ffb098c2360463b9667b526b9","27d4c95187205cf7ee5698d6b38709cab9368c72","2cdd4cccd1f8e33a25bcd1179046841511573c56","4849b4143ed013ee8b20f84e9fb59e6419e9fb7b","9df6aaa64dd473d14d8c9ff4d01f162b239be9d8","b75db62fa70cd792e6a111816ba19b8aae7051e1","0ce982d8e6f7dc1f09624ddd3ab20f68a6d3b4c0","7edb8fe0d66f18bc90ad0ae39c26a4ec03d00cab","8a470905ab5742cd65d39f87571ee503c284eef9","043882d32f11db1f6508be89e65739eb4ed41746","131adbf399e1471908d6e3d72afb889711e7a600"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302682"],"title":"Coca: An automated Debugger for C","doi":"10.1145/302405.302682","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302682","venue":"ICSE"}

Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction heuristics are highly accurate (93% and 77% respectively), and that we can recover 19% of the existing variability-models using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses. We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support researchers and practitioners working on variability model re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques.","inCitations":["33e92e292312d626056b098b2de6420ca265f87e","1022fc255bfbb6ca9be96946d7405de18925a6af","4dab423e4ddb3c14e0efed4edde1447f8847fb49","a1ccbdf97230344cb68cd244800bed9b20e9ad48","42bf653c370305690ae0a0c5573499d868491112","1521c2c45835a1dd3d29f9886010c652063b7bad","4e2a4679e9969c4629f7e3645edaf440506787af","0444be64dde44793d9bb9db600e54108829e98cf","ea5abe54dee3ae47a206efeb48c1ab9b09d1ebb7","497ceffa44dc17c811c437bb7920c94ea588874e","a1ea498ccf6a8f7a8d6520224caf38e317e2710c","f04f3fe09903e0a44ba06d37ea927aa4e3b76424","489f48185487c21d187dea4b2ebbd1553b554892","3e6e8e3ee84888c768c4d0b3a6a3897f53c39e7b","e307b8fe19f0728b752da24c2ba5d35700d9333d","e872b8c46e872f97ab02a81d98efdac3777697a8","5c024a8a5d7db8b5eea26f4a40248b85c9c6af0d","4c11a7b668dee651cc2d8eb2eaf8665449b1738f","75b18e2b00737a5ba8217b723846ec131bf0d9d4","91787e91ea35c05889def52022c75ac65001f92f","1d1fa7787838325841764515b0e4ef6fb6e61449","46d7358cf75f2455e646cf90f11605a7069688a6","3fb9f23acbb4d2c5e63fb5c83e282eced2190950","f857088618b87b848974432356bd682abe0d774e","f00b2146d7170a2695ba78199ab2b2ef30437a71","c42875cab85ef870dc4e3fbb194d9de900518f86","a65047dde59feb81790c304e4d5a9a7c25aa2acb","33b0e8144e46ffcb93134c005aa099ef1d6e931b","8f878b422609211e9cb3a76656a5ffa4b5e258b2","be085f8e36779ff99f5a605ee89477b03c0c2e93","f4c7159b806d7c2b37982b5b4ed2d1f617761318","c45d4d01cb2005f3525ac22e6e6151156538e928","0dc128c8e1cf5352dbc2bb4155dea72275d9a5a8","81c6d11bc582be37003fed7879901f610022f2ae","9bacde0b1f8d5386bf202d404f7b4da58cddea11","4d4a25ee320da22d36ca7af90e6e3e9f08391ca0","04e44c31f959de18953d603edc65e8b4c6d738e7","156c0e0e56f54db36c9bd9e57e1f6027f75df9d1","9539b5fe16255047930567a69c23adfe3c6ca3df","f8f6cbe92a7dd8c9f30d75194e3ece89faf0995c","4b0d08dbc08b3ee13aca6fa9eee49d460ef4abb3","c108a9577dd4404d2f755199becf479ca4650dd9","7ba5327cdba50c814ff2fdf9c74a595a8ec062e7","6f8c83c487c1b176fd876f9dade20d66a4b20985","7cd7c1e7ee5701d7ff29f09ec53c361b5a8ecc6f","1335dae3a20b5373afd25aa3a346f3c65956c017","ca1940f74216bfef365b44ebe0854596844f1b40","1d6e2b72c570ebb8d477628e8eb5b8a72863fabb","7052ef28ab934a8f6925b846d1d52054c361c8b2","be3f982d3920d5dea9cdaf4ee5b4785305abb178","e305bc95c1e79091b4e632b5c1b2fe362dad805c","3046c4bde694f175b0ac248256aa9cb539a8efb4","6845d1041c38cf7fe5679e237f5ee6c89b960561","08cbda913ce80734daf0140d08aeb548afe26e62","b7018b14a0a5e08ed61d8e2129e81b371687fbc7","2bf0ab9a6ac1746eb35a65d43def95c8b0409edd","2345da4fac8bf390f7c8ac1362b277a968ef2a53","6cb4c30384c10d285f9925dcd501c9b79df3e3cb","730961ddff008d42f099c38e62fe65689354c3a1","8d99d6c06e1bf1222e6c7111cb1b1ce0cb423818","f5b4402833455ca849f671fe301928f13cd4da00","7cdd9be79ab0591e49569028d7a1f80e44b154ee","572b1a1f4152511e4636610709c3cfa76b55ee98","9f94aadf6b2b57d6131e50af232a05e6dea1e48d","509c26ab71e36a6cff575359a412bab3843e59aa","9f84fb4b6c604a4bbe11a2b22fa221a4d67fbc76","26d3e33247d9e5f0885b9b0254df690adb3c4d84","b3fa8946f38dbaa30e6a264cebf1bc7133833f5a","a4fbc6a509e57672df549288b7011ebd3fba7f52","edb5b3359a46a6c818671afa216f49712575b8e5","9afffe04fe38d0c768b36d166500e8d964991896","62438b9f33c8105d1a34d57458cb7425fe561da8","0cc2d8960de61f7e9a0f7ed55a6db661b8fa1538","4127e226b4aa16d4a1569a6775e27111ba60907f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_mining.pdf","https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/icse14_mining.pdf","http://gp.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/NADI_ICSE_14.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568283","http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/sites/default/files/NADI_ICSE_14.pdf"],"title":"Mining configuration constraints: static analyses and empirical results","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568283","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568283","venue":"ICSE"}

A program is said to be verified if, for a given set of tests it can be shown that every case of interest has been tested. As this end is, however, unattainable, we will consider, in the following, that a program is verified if one can prove that all the logic paths in the program flow graph have been traversed. Therefore, we will consider that a certain degree of verification is attained with a given set of tests, according to the number of paths actually traversed. This degree of verification, which is a non-decreasing function of the number of tests can be considered as an assessment of program reliability. The degree of verification attained through experiments can then be deduced from the images of experiments in the program flow graph. This paper defines a practical procedure to perform such an evaluation.","inCitations":["3d285cd03c267d8dd52eac9bb9d76b1939483303","44f2dcf272d92b50b0fa1a4783996d696593f838","e7bf3d0e235c1879168d5dc7d4dcc20f35ba1bb5","93f90493ebfff5009c8adc7faa9e3ad5fa9d2551","333aa1a1463dd8a39acef717e03ba325d48090b2","108ec8667b26cd6a6b94849f648585ad82447f33","c7fce4d6476645128400a7e958076bf3ee638d5e","330702b90f854f143faf9ce31bbe49f7b1e55c92","73753cc966a4353a4229ff4bc1397fd832da1b57","6c56380f1572db8df27f340d0952d0884d262e7a","2c4c6d2780eaab71979eeb68442c683e790a4cc7","06f48bf7d6662b3b34100e9b33d92ab92a11e946","21b49fdeec3a1a5d783f615c2933a5fbe79207c0","469a8a597d9ee39da45cbde08b4d311252560fc1","45d6c2cf7c032e528833732f86b9ad2f7a9a28f0","798f1073ec97f47d487c21d64ac943c73419d1f2","84c7b7f7a71c1aadca4b393054cc83b227928df8","792127035bb55cf1a82fc712a0d6b8de90e36b48","c82111d09d6f07a85b65a6b3d31cbff29349ff21","d4fbc194b631adf607344edbaf0cfe1b7efa5eb6","d1aa717a7625d91ff9de11bfe7c7824dfd2b4d94","f16b0c82f2157fbe3ce0e2ef5ed99d9fbd12ba48","abea4f816a0c92328dfa543942e4beb60307a972"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807722"],"title":"A Software Reliability Assessment Based on a Structural and Behavioral Analysis of Programs","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Privacy requirements depend on a number of contextual socio-cultural factors to which mobility adds another level of contextual variation. However, traditional requirements elicitation methods do not sufficiently account for contextual factors and therefore cannot be used effectively to represent and analyse the privacy requirements of mobile end users. On the other hand, methods that do investigate contextual factors tend to produce data that does not lend itself to the process of requirements extraction. To address this problem we have developed a Privacy Requirements Distillation approach that employs a problem analysis framework to extract and refine privacy requirements for mobile applications from raw data gathered through empirical studies involving end users. Our approach introduces privacy facets that capture patterns of privacy concerns which are matched against the raw data. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach using qualitative data from an empirical study of a mobile social networking application.","inCitations":["3d1db23a8aa2eeb0cf3be91446d0296abecb8dc3","0e76c74dec6bf04ff1a5ca8fcf93587c9ccf3e07","4b816e48b67f3802182c5302a53eeae717bf6651","2d7dc80fee1f0d0ad307d7e2afc888f0f1954384","25a20464586c7a75c417a207861f067f53297fc7","4003c0fa24074cbd114d0cd853d87c5a1be42f86","5b9a96cc21ea7fbac1c406c32b4750392ced910b","02bdf24ffe17f1ac1e74836a0f27744c8b544ae7","2b0df36c661362c8e6bddd71e331d2203fc97cf1","89dc5986a3c97f5e7177a621872f7410cea4c6cd","443d96d8f3a7bad54b1c4b2b72bbdca85886f294","d6896f5fb208c07fcc67390029eeca6c6f20b71e","5b9d5cba01ab253fa6f48c2ae9eae9f155224cb3","9e63e827abfa7b039989eb2e03371406e94ecfbd","daec465c8882c009561b7e43cc649cf50cc6b02a"],"pdfUrls":["http://oro.open.ac.uk/39635/1/ThomasEtAl-PrivReqDist-ICSE14.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568240"],"title":"Distilling privacy requirements for mobile applications","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568240","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568240","venue":"ICSE"}

Query specification in Synthetic English parallels the user's natural thought processes, thereby allowing him to formulate complex queries without regard to implicit or explicit language control structures. Synthetic English is designed to be used in conjunction with the Functional Data Model, which is a conceptual graph model whose nodes and arcs represent sets and total functions, respectively. Further, the Functional Model admits a transformation to the Relational Model representation. Queries written in Synthetic English are easily parsed, using semantic predication analysis and the underlying graph, into primitive templates which are in one-to-one correspondence with the high-level machine language of the Relational Associative Processor called RAP. RAP is an associative and cellular back-end processor designed to support relational data bases. RAP's proven performance superiority over conventional architectures, its high-level machine language, and its query processing philosophy, make the interface to Synthetic English extremely efficient, avoiding intermediate-level code generation.","inCitations":["5b5b3c8d9359d36dc6cfa6b571cf7ef4998e1723","9293bf82f8071b1c5e9d62df1119b44aca98a44f","11e96beb34d0ee4d89bd1fa2c48ed384a18756f0","684d7e96a507131e910c3f605e227721c74bc5d2","a8d957f3d97679617d7b11323d52870b0780d04a","29b75dc428b7ea014b421d1ee901d6bc2c5cb494","89f7c3c069e79d74030e85f9c32f6472d142ebde","db16568eba36f2b68022b88cfa1c28119f36e4ea"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807725"],"title":"A Synthetic English Query Language for a Relational Accociative Processor","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Concept analysis has been developed by German mathematicians over the last years; it can be seen as a discrete analogon to Fourier analysis. Based on this theory, our tool will accept source code, where configuration-specific statements are controlled by the preprocessor. The algorithm will compute a so-called concept lattice, which – when visually displayed – allows remarkable insight into the structure and properties of possible configurations. The lattice not only displays fine-grained dependencies between configuration threads, but also visualizes the overall quality of configuration structures according to software engineering principles. The paper presents a short introduction to concept analysis, as well as experimental results on various programs.","inCitations":["76c2d662f631af74d728047b64ceecc890ba8786","1f671fa7e879f0c007c07955172f370d5edcf3a6","0b7deb43b352b9ba454c7184de9ff9f251357433","c70d6640e0c20b5e1d94d1dd87e27cda474db15c","f8e701ed9842adcea556efbb79d8d0cb0c83260c","51ce235c428c931fc97008a2d1b0dec2d4e822bb","0e283de4fbb6d0a4e99aa8f5cd5b4f6c13fabae4","267e5e683f526de775d4d76fa9db8b1196106c93","0f1f6d64a653c275e4251a29442272fcc3b74c25","fe9b6c87ef95d26a733363a19b9c2fbf30e3bdf7","2981fe95ad4d8e73a7b7eba09ca9e20c4fa722cd","03b5b84835b6878456acb75d78f6f7a0bc366248","90c676c57c44b84177735dbe885fcfa2c1c1b682","1a49eda576c555a62d51a264c8cce3e59e4f1687","6482e2a8251b25a918b1677b2829b8580efe10e8","57915831417fa6dd343678d21f51d1dcb080eb5c","637f3e8baa425f35959ec64f62bd4842a9806a70","3724675bb226d31ab94f6c884fe9081edd657ef9","c82f78cfff59d4df6c35a7451cc7efc935ced886","0259a629fd994eb8f8a12128cd861bdb73a8c719","96e7dc4db4d4be25524e2664672b37d949110f31","f3425d93f9266c77fc28b4e6e338df17c74eef23","e700425e084368ff6f1bee33e233aafa89c55853","998cb55df425b1b65eb7c95d8c6d4f532005e864","0b122274ff2b74c446278480f1b7128733605f37","f6a075e0712225e7601f4482bd2dfc3b3ebcdb0a","78303d3ff0420644dc995458a7cb60fb09030a4e","03efe12fd1591279dcf103b6bb56376c0d47d762","829583eb8001447b172ff69501bc58885549eb8d","3bff104f4bbe5510b592266d5390921885a12090","52294575ca8f163d94b4e105cd2da86e29e15ed4","0a2c9db80433b384af928ae947b6c4005c7c42bd","b188891cdcfb8c139b5a29f99a8da41e36deff41","65198db7f7236cffcf20044a2a58b5107e1e4113","f0c3ee4b43dc924d730149a46e4766b6d77e1ee2","d0d0985c6f91f961a704e461f59e239571e689e5","93206f6d8d23e682adcad120b01e64a61cf5574f","50cb79032e2caba184ea3971a026a987ed8bea0b","b4dbcd6c5de157102c72e55f6811d3dd6c3011a7","179cca96f9238f16f7c437b0d8f9507e81269831","07b66b7707a3ff03eabf5cdf4b1dee4442b63a8e","2d374ede93926c65db7a3b6c123b7b214ff3a7f0","23acbddafbe3c8d9a275707cd20ece31efd4043a","4766f1971636f7603e3464b30a31964b094ffd7a","7edf98d27a2c34c3f0f0a991442e24572a0bd19d","09f06249900f461224371ee65388b4cb0b79741d","19f7344199e2e7a1c1bdeb9d0b7d749b693c37e8","2abd0c8c5117004d0b7b70282b251c4ba4386239","2126967efcfbb88e52d17fd554d19655b19893c8","90ba748e4c35ceec0f7c4a5b0cf792fdb8383a76","a14f69985e19456681bc874310e7166528637bed","40a77720c463bc3977835fd208298d924be56cc0","88ccb5b72cf96c9e34940c15e070c7d69a77a98c","89dc915cac1886598ab74cbe7acc76e74356218a","80f260f23d48563ce9ec989c3fc985428739fa30","1aaf60c8b7d60f941d27e5bc3f0bc4772449ea12","52534e206b2f1703f82a2951d9135a2929af91d1","f857088618b87b848974432356bd682abe0d774e","2ce7dc6355b90d558ec68be4a26c1425ed9d178b","5e2e97a62acf8b64e0bc38e8225d9d04ebbd951d","73f50e0a385318d256f6d17b41996dc51dac4e0b","053b814c88395032d9ef02a8a482112f934fda60","1b834e10426e1afcb0532d8b8614c36f27244384","2b3a7559f518db123a4d6cfea57c235a82e4d644","0e42f7acccdac606970cd13b027c13c7d2a38460","281321393bc2f141a1c75197076faef058552b27","eb5865d5cbe6d6b508b19cc3ceb3889710e11ccf","3cfc0b445757a630e04cceaba3e401d1b2884629","b186f5b3d29e2a3788d9e18d3411bed05de76df7","01fd5d9cb681dc318957adcaad5544022ab3efd9","5a137705ab1f4ecfc35240ea46d6726e422f88ee","41316c3c67dd1e8b89902d7da0fff6421118a25c","57b61ba56c543b05b5b993f222b5367f1d6e494d","5379f7363a3c64d12200b038dfc7adc56421c529","67f6b1ea105cbb4dec1f4eb2950d919ca811ccf1","4d4c41c892d0556fc8c348518411b775b8e800f1","28566aa04344d568d80c4bf5767c7427c9a0162f","5d201f2cac2ab0dab2bf98c9b4e54059a692bd7d","221ddae2460d86bf984bdc93ab5da58d62e3a9db","6ac784d01a4f14d8d46e49cb802ee579c8db0874","1401996bbee116fd7686a565e5fec3ab86516b03","35ddaf5e73e75e7d1453db7ca73ced88ab4d42d9","45f3e1edb391241d5715f5fdeb09463aaf4c19c9","1f56f50bb00f550d09d6e4d2d9b6591820318111","e9a4de87fe458333d971fd593a0e5be373f782b9","e26264524d2a0c9a154f4c2e4f1ae5b71adc0de1","f6f13208bf6cf1b263e48fda7fbbd9eceaf1e552","bea030e3dc3e5fc99f4724dc425468317ceaf7ab","68b116562387d4cc1e959e81e81f1621552c069a","bdeea1abf4f6731dfd8414e9b14160d20f473030","ab0ef2d8ccaed371e69e37c7f286940c7e097f73","06efd8aff2163b1cdf69db49e675dba071ea91ce","1039953878902bf9b7dd627ab01270e7151752cd","2c16df89941129b3ee5f2e8ccab34fa986d61587","78309af65bffa9bf7a1cdc33fa2f9272e7660c95","126c253a3289a9614ae1996fdd4905854908ad8a","e2312c05198be0a472881e92701852a82347f7b7","38d3f19fdf7e9e9a0e97dbd045a9a92361c68799","1277fdb77cf24f11cef93e103f5426fc1d51d6a9","25b2893c33480060bb79b0c43f0f5ccf74af2c5b","fd038f2757816f23bab1e00ba3c708e470e895e8","201beda084d36dbf91618dc9da60a20495df75c6","0434d6df95aa685e4f661bc1bad31eb2c4f17610","27ecc1c2d9fa117906a1035d1c708dc17c300fbb","0d53ca36836eeab955ad3a7560172a401177afa4","a7b1638c7deb00bae50d769e3afdd6e195988901","8db9857848f6dd21ba9dca25c7de846b95f8dd00"],"pdfUrls":["http://infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/st/papers/infer-config/infer-config.ps.gz","http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590p/07au/conceptanalysis.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257742","http://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/krone94icse.pdf"],"title":"On

We recognised early that it was not enough to say how the system would do its work: it was also necessary to say what it would do. Then, in a further advance, we recognised that we needed also to say what the system was about: to describe the subject matter or problem domain. Unfortunately, this further advance coincided with the great success of database management systems in replacing collections of files: to many people this seemed to imply that a problem domain description should be given as a database schema or, more abstractly, as a data model. This view has dominated and hampered much of the work on system development method, in spite of the obvious fact that no business problem domain can be adequately described in a data model. Methodologists are now busy introducing other aspects, such as event orderings, into their models, but their work is mostly a struggle to cure self-inflicted wounds.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74606"],"title":"Software Engineering for Business DP: Looking Back and Looking Forward","doi":"10.1145/74587.74606","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74606","venue":"ICSE"}

For example, the Java Language Specification has four editions and is currently drafting a fifth. While the addition of language features is driven by an assumed need by the community (often with direct requests for such features), there is little empirical evidence demonstrating how these new features are adopted by developers once released. In this paper, we analyze over 31k open-source Java projects representing over 9 million Java files, which when parsed contain over 18 billion AST nodes. We analyze this corpus to find uses of new Java language features over time. Our study gives interesting insights, such as: there are millions of places features could potentially be used but weren't; developers convert existing code to use new features; and we found thousands of instances of potential resource handling bugs.","inCitations":["44455d330756a99e874bac4c7dd479b65a3dc341","c1a49a3cdf8b57262816e379445d859bc72944aa","1ae590bdbc22249120f66c65b2d7e3a0af6c40f5","9337e78352f5549382d383cb785e3106a321508c","50b1522146c865c44b2b0d19ae534b609d9bf57f","9b26c3ab26e9731912342968ea864a49dccacb6b","a494eb6cfc686aee892ffbe2cbcf86d56797a321","f698ea3765abd755234e23f769755dab3fdeb9af","6a2b18cf6a5f4ae38c00e5b882e469689dccee0e","17acf6c7a4167442bb600599f00afcae20ccfdd0","a73bd1dff0c3718d438d56c19239ddfd2e8149e9","89396806f74872aa713804881a9320bd53abf13c","9c89bab2e1f198c2d17ea89b985a26b7fe50686d","f543e39bef8dbdb116cd469d94fbad66b573e378","10e7f753944d450f4c3ce50b16a645c895b98220","83bd9dd01e790a595da7a4145c9353a422f07f25","9b4cdd17424baddf76b575b9c72bf54c200d9781","362ac80719ea57bf6aca038c05b7072d7ad3eb9b","51b68f2f009a16b4c8aedc86ec6a734464411ede","19580e4beb903595082ced092c0bc5ba0a2e7bac","01b9e0940072c8f31de09d61f7a9ee8e7e924994","76b54367b0778d9c220a3a760a4952b170eb4e2d","cc1b7e7828dd40d93d24dc17c7c855191d906aa4","78e952ca5a744e8cae3bb20e2637af88d41b41bf","dac1dba6ddfc3fc5a8e78e730f691787fa94d09c","c064a3f1e0d9d086baa50433435f884905e15177","178a226a4fa68d80f709d0cfff5f5458df0daad3","68f4fd4931ef39a1889631227a474ee97eca04d2","d63a0e7cf96c76497371cd2126e01ba49c7482ae","90f4ee00e7d0d92b3e0b27dbcbda12a33fbd8616","ce17d3b0cb01b297a66c70a237ae18b37e032cbd","4e982056808beae073b21a21496fc589e403f8c0","623c98703e9d2b4a14bf1502063e57d717005af3","d0e40da423f5e989bc3c4f7821a22d356d3b26a6","66dc89c717bf4e18cd8b278e33e5fe037a3a6b56","66959df127d2854e1f4b4496aa23e2d7e7be0cc5","d4323ea7b9667aaf7d3ac8d6ff45f1bd2cd00d8d","16b5db2c11e468f59a1e4f7236819b155ce27d66","3e8fa8fc89cbcd0160519195ec83f0e24f26f032","966e256bb7f9c3d31f952e6b92ad996eb2a6e5ea","cc1f2bcad5168ff80ffce7e3aaae85c4eb11e3a7","e423ad31cfb8b8ad3c6e0d835ed3e03337832b1c","c589875eedf88d116bc1655e22d924d8ce8d4ca7","338ec0476191e19ba96d38b34db9a752f0f138a8","114863231d07466e355e4c56b47d3cad9906af9c"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568295","http://design.cs.iastate.edu/papers/ICSE-14/icse14.pdf","http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/rdyer/papers/splash15-poster.pdf","http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&context=cs_conf"],"title":"Mining billions of AST nodes to study actual and potential usage of Java language features","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568295","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568295","venue":"ICSE"}

If senior managers fail to detect such risks, it is possible that such projects may collapse completely.\nIn this paper, we propose a new scheme for the characterization of risky projects based on an evaluation by the project manager. In order to acquire the relevant data to make such an assessment, we first designed a questionnaire from five viewpoints within the projects: requirements, estimations, team organization, planning capability and project management activities. Each of these viewpoints consisted of a number of concrete questions. We then analyzed the responses to the questionnaires as provided by project managers by applying a logistic regression analysis. That is, we determined the coefficients of the logistic model from a set of the questionnaire responses. The experimental results using actual project data in Company A showed that 27 projects out of 32 were predicted correctly. Thus we would expect that the proposed characterizing scheme is the first step toward predicting which projects are risky at an early phase of the development.","inCitations":["5347b61f4ceb6c1afba46f93fbd33b15b9a2349a","c6392c72749f73dacdee752aadcf16a0ec8c29a0","88ef137ec9672548bccb1e4e6c2d307a7052a847","2e61090528b050322170ce88c279b42afc98a285","ce88202c189b054ce6d72585047fbc9e9eae2896","24b9c7bd86d7d2dd02dd5ac65354e86f811ac1a5","c9ac5f6924dfd3625e42d1d66a7013d1e98e070a","10b4dd334893c12d81d61cff7cf2e3b2e6b1ef21","2fdd2705c34561c277e101fe190fd007667d991e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337226","https://people.dsv.su.se/~joco2917/ft_gateway.cfm89.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of risky projects based on project managers' evaluation","doi":"10.1145/337180.337226","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337226","venue":"ICSE"}

It tries to show why, in Europe and the USA, management has failed so often in this field. This seems to be due to a combination of narrow-minded attitudes from all the players: academia, work-force and management. Introduction The two main issuesthat I discuss here are the first two topics proposed for the panel discussion, which I claim can be seen as the main reason for the third. They are: Software Engineering does not produce competent managers, Software Development is still an individual affair, 1. Software Engineering does not produce competent managers Some general sociological laws apply: Zfawthorne: you improve what you measure, Conway: organizations tend to reproduce themselves [3], Peter: you rise to your level of incompetency [5], The classical difference between the technical and the managerial routes have been well documented [2]. People with technical background tend to focus on technical issues, when management should focus on human issues. Technical people are reinforced in this rut by being judged and rewarded on their technical capabilities. New project managers are usually not prepared to focus on human and social issues, because they have not been rewarded for this, until they reach that level. Experienced project managers have been promoted out of the way [5]. Yet it happens that some organisations produce flocks of competent managers, either per luck (charisma of some individuals), or by will (social aspects are taken to be part of the entire project, from the very “lowest” level of involvement). It is these later organisations that are the most interesting to follow and understand in this discussion. Such an attitude is very challenging to management, and seldom required horn it. The classical forms of management (authority or negotiation) are not possible in our context as they produce very few managers from the ranks, where many are required [3]. On the job education is short term, if at all: programmers are educated to become better programmers, not to better understand the management of the project. Both sides usually prefer it this way, as it gives a nice reference to your social position, and few unexpected challenges. Academic education is geared at the scientific aspects of the job, as the others are seldom recognised as worth-while (probably because they are harder to judge) within academia, It then reinforces the existing, managerial trends that tend not to produce many new managers. A very fast expansion of the field has not permitted the normal, small numbers of technical people gifted for management to take over the next cycle. Organisations have had to make do with whoever was there. Had the growth in the field been minimal, the problem would not have shown. 152 CH2982-7/91/OOOO/O152$Ol .00 @ 1991 IEEE 2. Software Development is still an individual affair This assertion is all too often true, yet seems quite culture dependent (ego-less programming is only possible where the general culture, hence the rewards -and trainingalso are ego-less). Most the bases for team-work have been available in the western computer field for at least 15 years [6], [2], but “tradition” and its myths are still entrenched (and reinforced by images of individual skunk works). In any case, you need fairly wide cooperation in order to obtain mediumto long-term success (see the Lisa saga, where the “divas” work supposedly had to be entirely rewritten in order to be maintainable). Management knows how to reward an individual, but is not usually too hot in rewarding a team (or even in building it, as this is seen as a potential challenge to its authority) [1]. Culturally, many individuals prefer being recognised on their own, rather than as part of a successful group. Furthermore, on their own, they often believe they insure their job security by being irreplaceable, whereas they feel that, as part of the group, their is no individual job security. As a consequence most tools and techniques aim at the individual worker, only do now organisationwide support tools and techniques start to appear (see the ESF [4] strand in Europe). 3. Software Engineering has failed in reducing the differences in productivity. See the above points: management does not want tight teams that will require a change or a constant challenge in management methods. In many cases, individual workers also prefer the immediate intellectual comfort of this type of personal challenge to the unknown of responsibility and dependence on other team members. Conclusions Overall productivity issues, long term economic measures will force the Software Engineering community to become more effective as a community, not just as individuals. It is the role of management at large (including the educational community -stop focusing on “theoretical software engineering”) to foster this change as fast as possible.

Application engineers have to deal with a new set of problems caused by mobility, such as low bandwidth, context changes or loss of connectivity. During disconnection, users will typically update local replicas of shared data independently from each other. The resulting inconsistent replicas need to be reconciled upon re-connection. To support building mobile applications that use both replication and reconciliation over ad-hoc networks, we have designed XMIDDLE, a mobile computing middleware. In this paper we describe XMIDDLE and show how it uses reflection capabilities to allow application engineers to influence replication and reconciliation techniques. XMIDDLE enables the transparent sharing of XML documents across heterogeneous mobile hosts, allowing on-line and off-line access to data. We describe XMIDDLE using a collaborative e-shopping case study on mobile clients.","inCitations":["6214f44f6d63b5e3a3eaed0fd300d52975ca8dbb","a9794cf6d6625dc4ebe052eac84294bb2aa64ddf","98d7ad3de9979600bc7f629a9553ae6a12f89234","052567de08295b08a453aa23dd1e6183b309dbc9","67ab9cd7e38acf3f3a0a057418c4e0c97315618f","8051b804dc3cb1d6b2ac206b86dfd8a6be7bab3e","4d7cb1051fb2ad75db36fd7ac683d63f44006313","9e5ac6f070f27653fe478540b72791a9f0f56387","0bb5b8ac85c3d9177d38349ef837ca8503773327","b9baf68d8bab429286404fa0fad05572d05bcb55","4ee7d010e3f89ee89d53b041388d91c890fc5109","6a97b8784abba286e60fd63013278973c604c45a","122435bd98d72a33f3c41e8b856fde416bc03b2e","c5199630fa2e9d38cdfe31604ecf7001da7927ec","0bd2af859ef1d9bafaa6f9eec880256207418f11","b64c0ac95b53ec44435b2bce20bcea1f14ebf6d3","8c9f2a7ab2d1eab85673cfeeb6f12edb49f3a7f9","539cb203f820bb8647c4aa3e72b3f5d0ccc8b6dc","a5936658f3aef688837db9247d8af71532ba5084","18e5a32ed13e828320d4ff3b7597a7a12a54c7d8","e7df3bea18f2923e920c89ea38ab15f115a43852","17c0cb1b4cb23989a18adf7fdf7e70521d7c3259","383a84c9737d357434e53ac401edf44fb177fa87"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581463","https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/papers/icse02d.pdf","https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/papers/xmiddle.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015584805733","http://www.zachariadis.net/papers/mw.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/papers/xmiddle.pdf","http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.emmerich/publications/WPC/xmiddle.pdf","http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.mascolo/www/mw.pdf","http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/s.zachariadis/papers/mw.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/papers/icse02d.pdf","http://people.cs.aau.dk/~bnielsen/DSE07/papers/xmiddle.pdf","http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/w.emmerich/publications/WPC/xmiddle.pdf","http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/l.capra/publications/mcze02.pdf"],"title":"XMIDDLE: information sharing middleware for a mobile environment","doi":"10.1145/581339.581463","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581463","venue":"ICSE"}

The D-value provides an alternative to software metrics based upon “per number of lines of code” such as error rate (number of errors per thousand lines of code) and documentation rate (number of pages of module design documentation per thousand lines of code). Using D-value, the data of software modules are much more fairly evaluated than these conventional metrics.\nThis paper presents the derivation of the D-value using the theoretical background of a control chart called u chart and weighted regression analysis. The advantage of using the D-value rather than metrics based upon “per number of lines of code” is demonstrated through an analysis of the data of four projects. The D-value is used to find the data items which actually relate to software quality, and we find that the quality of each module measured by D-value becomes better as the documentation rate D-value increases. Finally, using the theory behind the D-value, a new software acceptance guideline is discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=41775"],"title":"Software Metrics Using Deviation Value","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

While it is difficult to introduce all the XP practices at once, our knowledge makes it easier to determine more effective combinations of practices.","inCitations":["f116fe9aeee586f7431448afdfd6b8a1b4efb237","d75832198ad501a9b69cb58d810a4b0914e193c5","a2f47a774252bf479f494fbba859eee01b53560e","da4e57d43a4da276ea1d36b0c50470df22d53dca","9d1cf76dfe4ffdfc712953d173c0ea6ba93ba04a","c7b71969b0762cf5b6ad66525e4c254618e17aaf","77151a801331e7e1af41433294e85538432330b4","cd961b5a2f13409d24dbc0d1ff1ba5dd29e23c0a"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134361","http://www.empirical.jp/paperdb/papers/archive/87/87_2.pdf","http://www.empirical.jp/paperdb/papers/archive/87/87.pdf"],"title":"Analysis of the interaction between practices for introducing XP effectively","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134361","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134361","venue":"ICSE"}

How did client/server computing start? Most enterprises' IT environments reflect their historical development: Centralized mainframe implementations and alpha terminals. Following the spread and standardization of UNIX, its status as the standard operating system \" under the mainfiane \" was established over 5 years ago. The PC then became the next level under UNIX. Tremendous innovations in PC and UNIX technology rendered these hardware platforms increasingly powerful. The PC, supported by multitasking operating systems, such as 0S12 and Windows NT, has forced its way into areas traditionally dominated by UNIX, while UNIX machines, enabled by multiprocessor technology, have penetrated the mainframe world, where they are currently holding their own: It is commonplace today to find several thousand users working with UNIX in clientiserver configurations. 2 Customers – a Heterogeneous \" Mass \" of Widely Differing Requirements As a rule, the needs of midrange companies do not differ greatly from those of multinationals; however, the former are often restricted by their limited financial leverage. The globalization of markets and the enormous pressure to cut costs have obliged most companies to implement rationalization programs, reorganizing cost-intensive areas or outsourcing as necessary. This also applies to IT, both hardware and software, which is where standard software comes in. 3 SAP as Standard Software Vendor q SAP has to focus with R13 on the following: Covering industry-specific business processes while q 4 avoiding complexity, International features, Substantial financial leverage, Presence in key markets, Customer orientation, Localized versions, Multi-language capability Customers are looking for: High level of functionality, Distributed/local applications with integrated data processing for central decision-making, Competent troubleshooting and problem-solving support, Simple, intuitive design, Short implementation times and moderate training expense, Low operating costs, Ongoing maintenance and extension of functionality to meet their changing requirements, Software vendor's stability What Is SAP's R/3 Strategy? The experiences of SAP in the development process of IU3 in the discussion with customers showed that the software must be a solution that covers the requirements of as many industrial sectors as possible.

A common way of gaining insight into system behavior is to inspect execution logs and documentation. Unfortunately, manual inspection of logs is an arduous process, and documentation is often incomplete and out of sync with the implementation. \n To provide developers with more insight into concurrent systems, we developed CSight. CSight mines logs of a system's executions to infer a concise and accurate model of that system's behavior, in the form of a communicating finite state machine (CFSM). \n Engineers can use the inferred CFSM model to understand complex behavior, detect anomalies, debug, and increase confidence in the correctness of their implementations. CSight's only requirement is that the logged events have vector timestamps. We provide a tool that automatically adds vector timestamps to system logs. Our tool prototypes are available at http://synoptic.googlecode.com/. \n This paper presents algorithms for inferring CFSM models from traces of concurrent systems, proves them correct, provides an implementation, and evaluates the implementation in two ways: by running it on logs from three different networked systems and via a user study that focused on bug finding. Our evaluation finds that CSight infers accurate models that can help developers find bugs.","inCitations":["1030dd30d84b2651dce0680bc17f5087c5b1a042","002514e52e8480bf17ff6ba8f28a6ef3a6f229f1","eae6b5e2d61543f32578a885528964cbb3c7306f","bb56f160cfb832d04ae71751aedd3f07967563c6","d8114594c058447e39fa13dd0b50f5dba4aa701c","2b35508ebfee8aee1124c6576ab8fb8c00d46a50","035889b129dea8f071fcdb067067904836d78dea","8cdac8effe68de5edcd02730be4c802c3bb10be6","cd98b384daa5de44cb29e361d7c68e9b0c1abbaa","3012fb200f35e5303ece7e38d9d981d434cb8940","8bb95bc946b4232ca4a9b423a2d52a4c94694b0e","ee4363ae6159f8c692fe762c4b1a301f4acc5191","745589aa4c3b602e8274931ad5832ecd11c08193","e828892b37cf504790016eed5b19eae2a9d20d87","3848cae346a4856e66a9f6b6ad21be83575c695d","7e19dc6e55a9352839bc35e9a0467d3761c9c672","26576df64f71277620f873d044d092086bc3d804","202645bf69a5a6b2947bbcac86986d8a9762cf80","a39ee505b94b3056b783464cae8d7a5d6d3f53f0","769676e6e8626da478e1da967e72ae92534ac525","99f4c54106a1ebe316ee4a347e2312cba7063714","5abe445d3275f6ac8f3dd9fe1fdb11ea09ff0df5","8681fa540b786a1858a3d429c0fbcaf3aeeb52ee","25638e2bc23ac3fe8325b6a1c813d270206a4c16","6c3d905a82d0132b7ff06e415c03ed252a82ff1f","bed61ab526aa448a10c875a2ca3fa839bda8cea6","a49ca34cc757514795dc30976a34fa94a4542140","c9adb00b4ded5563c48a757975bbdcd016c49ce3","03b07422329ba7c6f99840f8760d599399a63bff","229f3a4771431e4bebf63d1ae1fae5a4646cd124","03db070307521d881807bda1fcd989860dd48896","ac0d58f1a03f3acf568f62d3b019d052abbad0a1","a739c5e98aa65de878faae7ef43d01b6a2e7977e","2d58ceb5ba3afb2b06c65ee9e7d783d04634bf92","2dda0d73ac2723296c9e305af38644e8c10f5af3","d387e861ab3a88fa97448ae1fdb125eddcc712cc","2c0249a9514faf9f6054a5fd979b1192550f6f5a","264dd2356c6b8d7e048ea95b48830dec79816c11","33d986334f5c606b2065e49718a2211f1b559836","69a613dd7ab8aeea0029790e6927f94a607bec67","5c9fcce1609f94e5087d8eb7a82b21a351609f4a","3d75ce68119ab0117a912c4c4ddd1a694ef9387d","0da0ce23fccc1b2b84d633526a34bc4b6f2c5679","7074a66c45298793e97e3900f27b8a74a40a081c","26e8fa86fc2921d4eba38c8aba93792431c5a98b","1bae06d1da0a5c8b8b2dcb8619d1becc93eaa804","62764d97d3f1b5a9fda8b538b98cd31c42d37776","fefeded74334e5eafa47c5df6de2837fe3b7502d","0cd01b91b0a270c48b216a7ddb50f999e6cec394","eaa1d69e7fd3f6a66a4b590fec6044fb46ab03f8","18fb865dfe6a88c974004d67fd98b857a91cd12b","79aec2093b2a1b0197e7d145b5cf86abc70fee3e","916e56db6f2278a3d86ad733ab8153992cfeb742","2222d8cc495bba35232c4cd9275fe6d1e277c18e","5d72a7c3f05d6659ee3961c176e03c973b64b022","9a2298690f543f4f65a74aa6e9034d86dc2b85c2","5a4ef9aa1632b32fdac50d228c7b0e48d70e5ae2","fe5be3ac431c89b9b3220f28f06b4efc8dd0c281","eadf2f29493b75d210a574fd06f9c53b3c3ec6f3","2e7d283fd0064da3a97fef9562a8cc1bd55fa84a"],"pdfUrls":["https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/concurrent-models-icse2014-slides.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/icse14_csight_slides.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/icse14_csight.pdf","http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/concurrent-models-icse2014.pdf","http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/pubs/pubs/Beschastnikh14icse.pdf","http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~arvind/papers/csight.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568246","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/csight_ubc_tr.pdf","http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/concurrent-models-icse2014-slides.pdf","https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/concurrent-models-icse2014.pdf"],"title":"Inferring models of concurrent systems from logs of their behavior with CSight","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568246","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568246","venue":"ICSE"}

From 1993 onwards there are strategies and projects to reach the Brazilian objective on software quality. Since 1995 there have been nationwide surveys on software quality every 2 years. This paper highlights the main trends on software quality in Brazil based both on the results of four surveys (1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001) and on other pieces of evidence. The paper concludes that the software quality in Brazil is continuously improving.","inCitations":["36aecf13979fb8ac1d0137f1a02f47aebd25d929","8ba17514423b541ecb42cc52323ff75d95e7621b","273a6be8b2cf0dfab73d042f7e8b7d344ed699e3","cfc432a257fb9ef3c00b59f7e3047496724edd97","5b81b802a932f64df3cec636866ac72ac7dac47a","66971caab4649c35d474d414b2e0140cb493f820","78fd512e14af8a9c2bd7e27daf57db9f33249a4b","4187f10e2c4be55774f147c7edd3b6ab8213d08f","0604a364e68f6654cedae4a3982e0a7f652ea9ae"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581420"],"title":"Brazilian software quality in 2002","doi":"10.1145/581339.581420","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581420","venue":"ICSE"}

It is an excellent tool for modeling data and algorithms, but its object semantics are single threaded and operations are atomic, Therefore, it is difficult to use Object-Z to capture the behaviour ofconcurrent real-time reactive systems. On the other hand, Timed CSP is good at modeling real-time concurrent behaviour, but has little support for modeling the state of a complex system. This paper introduces a blending of Object-Z and Timed CSP, known as TCOZ. The blended notation is particularly suited for specifying complex systems whose components have their own thread of control.","inCitations":["a4da703eaecf301599b9fbe2478b88051deb482b","39f9ed61bfaa0b3fd59fbf7739174d1a6bc89006","c7fed5b1fd8000e3362b07ac24af7e7b50a88283","2ed5999d5bbc1f8143b54a367f02d768454549ea","47d45c3a1c24bff3069d84804537fd2106b5dcb1","6780787f3daca8953ef034fa3ad3283a52bda1ea","c4597656cb512914f125a261a83112c859d8958d","459983ba0cde10e269c48ba2bceeb1bf3046bb6d","5cb7ee660485042208dbe83de14d5c5535449287","be168c9ddc74c6b1eb397ccdad89a9d9b94da1a3","64a4cfd9e4fda26eec465157ea158947856c2f49","b8e79b19d9cc3560c30026cb848851eddde16102","3e21535665987c5dd6124b806aaafa6e8adb6b37","cf0ad2ecc8dde14ef791e45079a64d64404ae754","764be7b9b219e9ae29c0a71ddc9f4f4a730574de","bdb2be53ea50af6e201f6da0daaf7322c3b0d7bb","15ad19bdda49b4343ed8d34e7fb3635b62a0442a","23f43983cc7a80bc53578fff696f392c1423603a","2b537ddfd35b70349a25c431c0ce287221698756","034a34cbd585c20b25095a0203050349225885eb","efae60352b35bd38268ae883c86923ff0c331bfa","7f8b08844557cb5a55cca591e827572fcc873059","40b3cf6686ba2f037382fe0eb5b3fca103a7173e","6c65d8b1cba961bcf9f65f470c15f449ec8854ed","1142d07177beab232928580823b1f42158d12a72","b16c6b5f7adf36555a689246afd36cd23c9fba54","48b5ae56019c1c18f0cd4bbc6ec166e7242bdb45","372bcee4b16cf528eb5bdb74fb2d1a21d6e0f79e","094c9e50a787c1fb851b0e2324006cbdc758819b","0082ad2765c9979063c3cbd9035ac187f1fcd0fa","6de0128fcc7f434cf776d7673d8c9ec0332ed6d9","fe4346ee75f104345bee1e56aefc98d337dc8d16","9842041d3566f0e7214fb107e1c36f255a86e0ec","d77d8ad1fe77b6e46e92444fd824f93a0c1e2232","02a4b8f7ce47d7024ad12f370b895469f98273df","4d7ed9f1160dc574a1be06a71a894f916c46bc4e","2fc6335961b5771bedd3b38749a40e1d49dd6a6a","3a8c1be2eea1d2a59b427596abf11314f548bf42","7916466bfe561c59ef4ce503353de0a1e25e5171","7174e722ac6868306897065b86e5e5e1408b7bbb","aa8c373df50d71aba0243204cc2eeaccb3a4c0b1","a72cb0f575255792f4e68ee600f1a9980f97e873","2e602b4dab8b53a80fef0aaee735bbe17b3b9a71","9995a990b1c436af3c115b85bd982b2163b87048","7ccb9f61fbb6cfcf7602554ce10040af885665cc","b1bcbe2635de5f5c3cf84b07244db3768d79a5d1","b3dc46978da67e27c3d23f18197457967e1d187f","caa91b7529ea90d6bd8ca1e4c22b9e74daba159d","275626825a1be7f35e1a648cbaab970ed07eb13c","0b921eb0926807c417c7e3480c094b53c6f00845","0b02ed7f00ce3bf813f07e6a8aad57f2b959ce2a","266bfd157df1a84e84ebdeb2c1af15a6a308d1f7","faedfb0e8568d33562c0d566d6c0706f9576d5b4","7d7878a729b8c314a5ed1d14b3774909fbea2c53","7d5f01170e94c8873f86efd12407989abcb35917","fb2936532581dc44f0140a9c682517e3e081ad53","73be3aa9fd341aed3aa2e46c280d878f59820530","4d66ce1644fa4d8c92611b7a0b5ea198bf07cc55","689569c1e443c7c324103190d52c4f8a8e5aaf02","5eebe8eaf2d2098caafa5a2a333536c595d8f02e","63d4ab9f7ea89d042feb4d75ac1d4c1a2a9030d2","ab11f8b7a3f6cb9fe72d3fceea11f605ed26274e","999c685d2466728ea401b61bb8661a37dec7c966","c70ab38d3b634cec4bf6bf96c94c9a7aa74f7455","75d2bae2815010afaee5785e5f2c24288e715058","b0a4dfbceca720ecb2234a11b5470000b8911b14","b32d86867154313a613e25244d88e67840b2a992","afb7a431a5a98027190a916a1eb3dadfe63895db","a252974e4d7262ea3c1c78a3010631c18dc5eca4","1e25957d7583ae4ecf2722d64ff6be029ca25098","c76e5f1d40201989d8192052e06f29036aa64c49","5c47d52aa1f3fecab5356639396ace5cd53b4845","f4b4c77bc40b3f54d9dbe25bc5ffd9fae1bdbe66","f5b284e6e2a22a2c7ac17606c074c75ca1d246f5","8a11c343ae5b36a97b1369f8e19677183423040d","b78121e5d93ba92962bf8f4bd6b9c464fffd4ee6","d7a4ca899a2cc1690ec19361c170606669d77610","d8eaf35a9df65a105dc56737f4ac757098b8b3b9","5f246f06ba409f28b26feacde4a4220629667dcf","f55842d4097e271e901622e5fed6ed1d6d22bfa0","ef858e401e45629a6a0aafc26afa92539f2bfeb5","28a066a0e5ad9081a8a5c8f0e35ce78ccfd23f10","b10d79391fefb4c374755fed01547c799b30f6b4","a9614bdd2a904e2a7b53ca43bc8f243f55f47719","63b5441f3d8c916fed617cb273370b36721109dd","27720d1f0f89c9b9326f4f26b58d5a201de843a6","e853564ad2f377bb8ed08a0ef42031d5116a8200","e4ce1680fe8e0b943dabc7537cf24af7143084ae","a455e656129101d9ca76a6c295e8aed860049c96","1d1df7890e98553b75d55f412a5ab4abe34d0fd6","2aa65b587e24d585db1f9dfc2db63e3cef12ae31","4c62ab1c1f47ef51217d0f7222cef805681d0e8d","3b938dc8b91788c9c2d2f06bd854131ee8e603d8","b0c8e0e4248b9009af6bd7528937662150db808f","0b41f06440d89ffb58380f31b76165681e163ad7","b5d7f6eb62194f42c149b014c0a5f0f3d5fee101","22518e278b242dd5279e6071362b342301c7c2ec","2af4baa7f32d8ddc5b14a4c681e598321973ca05","e0aeb281189e4797953454c2072ea996c0b85591","4208901a76d8ce5380550a127425885649e877b1","ff7522fa4f85bfe19fec676557648bf7aa520988","675ccd651c5c03b753cf52ff812c72fe2c07f8b0","29c183e6a3468a8d6553c4ec722705798c890a0b","f40da16b75b04e4999d6fd7aeeb0ce3f36dd841e","07fbeb09d5c729a5270b75979caaf97d86d4db79","feeae356c8775d0f06ce35b885b3507b275b3a21","f1ab3322e7751593db66a9d648db75046d79fc8c","7c9d801cc5294bd6e259c243aba6435cefd9ca35","3a698e443dd489fe9b0991843ae8a718c0c1b4c3","640966edd5a2f0aae8d0eb98481ab87728fad6a3","29e6a4256824c206e3ade2b90b6d517e4c661faa","69faad2975d6e2b133840bce1b2179d80ae42759","9b138f9820003d0b6940c71c265e161ca2c58b6a","2534081272818d2b6ee84e41e506af54f62d31f0","00edff419843973e916f63cc31ae1267ed249546","db5d5903a5906d33ccee9f0f2f6e0

Performance regression testing is an effective way to reveal such issues in early stages. Yet because of its high overhead, this activity is usually performed infrequently. Consequently, when performance regression issue is spotted at a certain point, multiple commits might have been merged since last testing. Developers have to spend extra time and efforts narrowing down which commit caused the problem. Existing efforts try to improve performance regression testing efficiency through test case reduction or prioritization. \n In this paper, we propose a new lightweight and white-box approach, performance risk analysis (PRA), to improve performance regression testing efficiency via testing target prioritization. The analysis statically evaluates a given source code commit's risk in introducing performance regression. Performance regression testing can leverage the analysis result to test commits with high risks first while delaying or skipping testing on low-risk commits. \n To validate this idea's feasibility, we conduct a study on 100 real-world performance regression issues from three widely used, open-source software. Guided by insights from the study, we design PRA and build a tool, PerfScope. Evaluation on the examined problematic commits shows our tool can successfully alarm 91% of them. Moreover, on 600 randomly picked new commits from six large-scale software, with our tool, developers just need to test only 14-22% of the 600 commits and will still be able to alert 87-95% of the commits with performance regression.","inCitations":["e07bd6dfac84e002923896ef89f248d6af7f606f","85e7bcdb3634650f9fed934a562189c9f0e66d57","4af7e533521c69b8adf4a8266d595a0f2dd6acf1","0c1bf6da80dad0d272f3c87bc0e8ba365219b017","263a44d1b0c429190017b17644b4b7e9e20217a8","1cd47acec56a1908bfae10f83bc5153ea1e00042","d475fb7ed23c7b09c9306c3cd5ead95b1167e936","305979989bc63d70f2f4fd42036e56058b8c7d6b","e3bf7b482a1d1858a7e542ac9601f9cc2f57b817","91bc68f8dc732d6df48cdb3af7b781b3f90a10eb","2497ab5ef44b3628a9765165d48a93d3e22a2e0c","83c907ad5753f33f26cc800377f61baadb791f47","7bf376f5d7769f94b181740df2794d1a397b7ac9","fb6409e86fbd27f65b6fbbf7a448a1be958bd206","f3510b7d1d2d7489fcffe1061e5322dc7317c85b","5520674bf1dc5086b40e6f6f29f74b6c7f8fda62","695cbfd49892b57eca42eca2e9a113c76a3bc5af","c7f489dc951507a22b1aae680ebd4e8622a489a0","8c78d145c4cce770e9118639b104213f2eb39ab0","2dc80bb104118cf34518351c4c11f5213680bb04","e30da47d1711de577c01ea1b14945f2231e2844f","6ef591eb39be15aa30f7a753d66aa9200047f3dc"],"pdfUrls":["http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~peh003/talks/perfscope_talk.pdf","http://ryanphuang.com/talk/perfscope_talk.pdf","http://ryanphuang.com/paper/perfscope-icse14.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~peh003/application/papers/perfscope-icse14.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568232","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~peh003/papers/perfscope-icse14.pdf","http://opera.ucsd.edu/paper/icse14-perfscope.pdf","http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~peh003/perfscope-icse14.pdf"],"title":"Performance regression testing target prioritization via performance risk analysis","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568232","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568232","venue":"ICSE"}

The availability of a collection of design patterns can help both the experienced and the novice designer recognize situations in which design reuse could or should occur. We have found that design patterns: 1) provide an effective \"shorthand\" for communicating complex concepts effectively between designers, 2) can be used to record and encourage the reuse of \"best practices\", 3) capture the essential parts of a design in compact form, e.g. for documentation of existing software architectures. Since the patterns community is one that shares information in an open forum and builds on the experiences of others, we chose to submit a joint paper on our industrial experiences with patterns. We focus on the lessons learned in our respective industrial settings as a first step towards answering the questions \"Patterns sound very promising, but how are they actually used in the industry and what benefits, if any, do they bring in practice?\" We proceed by briefly describing each of our respective experiences with patterns. This is followed by a joint \"lessons learned\" section and conclusion.","inCitations":["78225af072fa56819141ef305358af4654f9bba3","38bdba07972764a79ccabea82ab483a6dbd1441f","c209527fa7a67cf072710b6b559f7740a9a4c492","d6f1ac0dd71f0ed9dc7ff656eac6f488c7899e57","27b01043ebdf1acc3a34a69380708b7814d9546f","aeab2cd939d0f0aab90b817dbc5094abb84435a5","d12c5981d5392cfaa5aea8b793aef1a985387919","8169bce3d7c392336253523cd323734ac547032e","f5e5fa1c387f1d4c8b4d79bbc534f80e2f764d7a","edf578016fd90ad36764a4eb6ce65ac19a5a8399","5f290aa59ab54162f1598ada862ae4677ca4a3c6","5989bb07e9e2fffd90970986e0e966b1cdf8b7ac","ad7dbe1304ed6c5192d06b271618041a7d709499","25e9b833a0d28814634dd86b7d9cf0959543bea6","d04a24bd962945a89fb5f619c69ead3973e21371","009a0875c6f008f01d4a5a2155906053cc35bde9","b3037d80eab47baeab6b3af3e4478d5df5d28f3a","f9349d68ab905a89bcc27bfadd8c669ab5823dfd","4424663b042347dfdc23cb0744640cf55f5388a9","b2c72572298fd2177240d7745d854fb55652374d","d6cd9c889aabd2617d28109cb11c8405bed9c9fc","2b29ac8da90e6736409f957c9ce9966bfbfc3e6e","1a1b9f4560057684ba24efb02ad3fcba8a508000","8ea411c90b708be4e66100f94af6bd442319d4b1","10320b863210430fce1442f294b9f7e4d53b26f0","955d67f68f0a9a469178f48d4cc79d015a5cf3fb","a1b018dfc4be0414b095067fceb3e704b84f5eea","22b72c32cb45195ddc213ffb86d9e9c42886c988","69a1a70942a22c91e60edc1019c7c68c3a6a76ab","7ef90557cc8aba6286bf97ae06c1a279a5b59eb2","9b157c5406cfd08b883b04f6642580d11025457b","dc271ca4202942a1f11b49799945a2ab20c6dc87","cfc7d98084a8547ee2029454e7e3af1bd390aa6f","10225e2c0c6bd21314d231fb34823bf73edafa11","29443667abac29be6b37ad577885ae61183b9271","c48031fee7303604267277bb01eae6710dbe643b","10476c0e759ed7b8ea282f0a8538ff23b60dfefb","7691b1def448893cc231e05b73810f11641881b4","5453efc0f79fdf066c0c990fd9b3ff036571cc72","8b2aa001c0021700ac8bd203648b8d9b88378f78","f42ee97191d3ac08fdc3d7d8e5fc2374bf0a4a90","570d8c97859f0aed98912dcfef4f836b952440a9","206b5bfcef8f28fed28bf79b8feb217c67ab9476","a00793c4f3891f987efd9ad6f4c741d6ceddc027","ae34a14da8cc9feddfbcfd8522a833e3e9810dec","b1f683823c7c9dfa91659be328a44612b08b1f0b","4071970da6395973c0e69f3f3feb939663bb31a4","563e03111afe33e4679d59b537c4fdc1535d1a6b","73701cd2b7a76147f40ae096e8a3b392d6ef40ff","0812dcd3361deededee57d9cfc3090c5df4902e4","f609da5448e8dd5cd04095010518dcb4dca22bc0","0ca60174915348f0b4020c7edc0f466042e0aebd","df16e8cfd3064d01f3d4cc064a1d2e79214ea2f9","db3f877491f175a54e757b4154b93131f33c3deb","7cd71035fb43ac7da68a3917887bf9f72baa1525","3e5e97a5e84263559ef44517ff6353594f7a4bfd","043a177bfe24f510fe19eccfa48843e833925297","23f175dc40f90a8316e5b7c1f073111c65d2539e","292401b268bb64c33ec365cebb932bc5445b842b","112ab96f3f798111be99b4dc582b0eaa89aa37a7","85e4d21d22934d5b23a5765a020b6f959d43a989","b2096797b118e4fa75f762d1740aeaaa61612af6","b79410621a26582ff79825ef78b7fecadb3234d7","a7687f7661c56c8b5f56aa1b8089cbfaae2211fe","5f6f2da27929b7f1c03142a5b4b98d654ea8551b","85b59f7e18ab621e9ebd3990fcf303cd615a2340","0699f553dfbeb3dfc007f332513e65a86caaec65","56543f46d4dd65af8a841430666670657e1b1fe5","c46bdf0d04ce65d651680b44fab7d9b8a5167e7b","932be8e3b109e5114586bf7c8f8c50c2d1517e25","94dbb995693611ed205f9de3ab608a9b30736e7a","59f85b9524c958f30f2afc9dea083cc577f3d86d","e810d1b6a6b0ba1ca9162c483aa7ee6860d38db7","2a72806003a1f2a2218e264d6f080d74e374723d","02705b8234c2037398a172aa7b1ef5b0e588fa90","3379f3bebad9d98fb88a11b9aa8ab09c4224bb5f","490d46f349387b0e1ae4a4d846f100e17a381b32","282d4ab670bca80fa97515b82b3399c597cd5a22","c457c79dd667290e1cca0acd71769b2fc017bd62","3b380132034099d28e398d797f5306b6b4f90d4d","730fea1c39d0d20c8f932eab49fae8efc73b0979","623df29ef0ec6c5f5fdda26d85107409aee3270f","44919130a650d08721c599e6a28aa6890884cc39","23ec5ab5f48bcfecbba6633748aba086e7c115e3","2ac0c6cc7d039e683ddf17401cc2eb6f2e0ed65c","79c5be9e4caff09fb13ff4c4d800a3c79747c73d","494f3e8169855548f76d7906c5c3b74b2197365e","1766501b65e57514c20fe5746119d71222a3f5e3","b8a88156f99851ffbba7d841317ff6918921bfdd","335f1bd44cddc8c7f4f26312482818378dafd2b7","61a8bdf2d0f985f693c7ea9fb04b0b570a78eca5","1e3540414b7bf477d7c7f159533069a5f95a32c7","16ca239ccec031279715f016cbf678aad1ddbe29","794f56253048f06b4208cfefbc3fd094e385d8f9","71f5e5cbd07d0cf0aaa610269f9cd88d70075082","020aab0b7693130b1d6f904e106c35e639642ca8","2972719029a179e9cee3ac1a3f0d4fa519563d4d","6adc8830b44502e8e835d10b17550e301605b914","325409fdbcd162232ece5572441df1265c896915","8aeda1ea3a9cd166008c965cdf7594a2eae212bb","1ee3bc45d7ff77abf3b6369217b5228957fe5491","6f4163599191e457613005a3f90db9d03960d978","35f6687803c3f5bf1779b7dd596ea4fcc8708477","22ceead21b119544b8cf0c76d8e90fd4db7ef7cc","cf506a399bae47a472130fc1479b68d8f3698a1f","22771960acbd9a46f188fec249120307ccab80df","42fcdd84c13ebd0f10c6e9b41475cc8cfd250e0c"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=227726.227747","http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/papers/icse.ps.gz","http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/481/readings/design.pdf"],"title":"Industrial Experience with Design Patterns","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The proposed framework is based on an idea that object staleness can be better leveraged in regard to similarity of objects; i.e., an object is more likely to have leaked if it shows significantly high staleness not observed from other similar objects with the same allocation context. \n A central part of the proposed framework is the modeling of heap objects. To this end, the framework observes the staleness of objects during a representative run of an application. From the observed data, the framework generates training examples, which also contain instances of hypothetical leaks. Via machine learning, the proposed framework replaces the error-prone user-definable staleness predicates used in previous research with a model-based prediction. \n The framework was tested using both synthetic and real-world examples. Evaluation with synthetic leakage workloads of SPEC2006 benchmarks shows that the proposed method achieves the optimal accuracy permitted by staleness-based leak detection. Moreover, by incorporating allocation context into the model, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than is possible with object staleness alone. Evaluation with real-world memory leaks demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for detecting previously reported bugs with high accuracy.","inCitations":["47225c992d7086cf5d113942212edb4a57401130","4136c581d46e0dd2a2b60852e00a826eae4dc969","00ece4537bdccc53e1d726b554d7b24d986096c4","57b85bd908e29640037fe4fd626ddf669744c2b2","5a0a225bf9260e49123dd1e7847917953a9dced9","3c902294cb3230f81c504b63afffbad41cc302a1","81d7fbcbb335ad62bb7bf33a558e9cda4723efa3","f9a0f90b36d6c3e6cf2d0f8b9c519fa5be8543fd","f256cc110393ac3a3ea449b88de589c6c5081d6c","66fe3f7c67b402545cd7b5b42616f8091fda8b1b","b00e5f0c0bd5b4a6bd903f3e3cb44b23fdf39eb7","2a0acfb92186ee0dda3b9e28f04ad8f547c4c3bf","089aaf8775c37306aef09691fe5d2e86d6f2a506","7bab43eb94430943a6883acced0453a98e1e62c6","3c1e7ec6adec33ceafcae47a712aedba2b9fc262"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568307"],"title":"Detecting memory leaks through introspective dynamic behavior modelling using machine learning","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568307","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568307","venue":"ICSE"}

As systems are maintained and enhanced throughout their lifecycles they appear to follow generalized behaviors described by the laws of software evolution. Within this context, however, there is some question of how and why systems may evolve differently. The objective of this work is to answer the question: do systems follow a set of identifiable evolutionary patterns? In this paper we use software volatility to describe the lifecycle evolution of a portfolio of 23 software systems. We show by example that a vector of software volatility levels can represent lifecycle behavior of a software system. We further demonstrate that the portfolio ' s 23 software volatility vectors can be grouped into four distinguishable patterns. Thus, we show by example that there are different patterns of system lifecycle behavior, i.e. software evolution.","inCitations":["7cd55405b190426f27ed41d9d082eb55d8f3ceb2","f0a9f70bc03a2439a3cb5d5fe358d295c2a8c772","a894abe6eb6455d02019dbf1b4a6ffb299a9ebb8","6b9aadf68b659a4045e19f5006c389900b887d3a","65b7e00e642face6664243917c113f66269f3e59","89ca567314f300f376dfc7601c20076e7a20ab4b","f6ffc0b051e87b384912b9b9841d3088c6c1d5bc","8e7079177f9ece200b965a865506a39e6da04b2f","2579813f2edf6901d13a9c419d9ea03d24a184b4","73f84ae56536537232937d20da8e51760f5be924","4511243019055068dd37ad171024083246edaea1","5e0f981254f2d7e02d6b274ed1e170fa74dca655","650816ff4be8ceb924e9cdd4539feafcbade2b41","7469694a4e9b1b7bcc929cb7168538b4b71c8459","f83dad089cb241eb085445cdeae1174ad5aa0746","9cb6604d9b75bc5ac2c560417970a79adc5f3dd5","26c7d1f98d49ec54edd3a66779e77bf34a40c887","63aac2729a206a15a2f90145f5ed6c39cce2875f","b562ff2f0ec314d8a28e58a9c42ee3ad6fb6a430","ae8feeb5f61e5623996193aacf14167e1c3f0715","c05ce05680a34c97b0238344614a492f170581f1","4b32756625704223b00d294f4614ae28ab38d045","09cd951baba8b60bb790f16f7665138a02309ef2","bc57889e611b3ae96aa1718cea31c757536887a8","a80517888c0304f1f39be242cb72a14404bcb362","0903942cf33239b7d7719cb0711cc35ccb9f9dcd"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pitt.edu/~ckemerer/CK%20research%20papers/OnTheUniformityOfSwEvolutionPatterns_BarryKemererSlaughter2003.pdf","http://www.pitt.edu/~ckemerer/ck%20research%20papers/ontheuniformityofswevolutionpatterns_barrykemererslaughter2003.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=776830"],"title":"On the Uniformity of Software Evolution Patterns","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper describes our development effort, sponsored by the Committee of University Teaching Development (CUTSD98) Grant, in designing educational material on Object-Oriented (O-O) testing in an Internet environment. The aim of this work is to enhance the state of the art in learning O-O testing by visualizing the testing process and interactive courseware in virtual communities. We have endeavoured to create an effective Internet-based courseware known as LIGHTVIEWS which contains O-O testing case studies described by visual images, animation, and interactive lessons, to assist active participation by learners to result in better understanding and knowledge retention. Our approach employs appropriate UML diagrams, makes the diagrams test ready by including details of constraints as part of state/event transitions, and provides interactive lessons for learning O-O software testing. We have used four case studies to explore the various test selection techniques. We have included black-box testing at unit level in case study 1, and at the system level in case study 3. The case study 2 has been used to illustrate event based testing by visually representing the dynamics of Java applets at work, and using interactivity to learn how to test Java applets, threads, and applet communication. The case study 4 explores the various aspects of distributed components testing.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337532"],"title":"LIGHTVIEWS - visual interactive Internet environment for learning OO software testing","doi":"10.1145/337180.337532","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337532","venue":"ICSE"}

Change impact analysis (CIA) is a technique that identifies impact sets, i.e., the set of classes that require correction as a result of a change made to a class or artefact. These sets can also be considered as ripple effects and typically non-local: changes propagate to different parts of a system.\n Two classes are considered logically coupled if they have co-changed in the past; past research has shown that the precision of CIA techniques increases if logical and semantic coupling (i.e., the extent to which the lexical content of two classes is related) are both considered. However, the relationship between semantic and logical coupling of software artefacts has not been extensively studied and no dependencies established between these two types of coupling. Are two often co-changed artefacts also strongly connected from a semantic point of view? Are two semantically similar artefacts bound to co-change in the future? Answering those questions would help increase the precision of CIA. It would also help software maintainers to focus on a smaller subset of artefacts more likely to co-evolve in the future.\n This study investigated the relationship between semantic and logical coupling. Using Chi-squared statistical tests, we identified similarities in semantic coupling using class corpora and class identifiers. We then computed Spearman's rank correlation between semantic and logical coupling metrics for class pairs to detect whether semantic and logical relationships co-varied in OO software. Finally, we investigated the overlap between semantic and logical relationships by identifying the proportion of classes linked through both coupling types. Our empirical study and results were based on seventy-nine open-source software projects. Results showed that: (a) measuring the semantic similarity of classes by using their identifiers is computationally efficient; (b) using identifier-based coupling can be used interchangeably with semantic similarity based on their corpora, albeit not always; (c) no correlation between the strengths of semantic and change coupling was found. Finally, (d) a directional relationship between the two was identified; 70% of semantic dependencies are linked through change coupling but not vice versa.\n Based on our findings, we conclude that identifying more efficient methods of semantic coupling computation as well as a directional relationship between semantic and change dependencies could help to improve CIA methods that integrate semantic coupling information. This may also help to reveal implicit dependencies not captured by static source code analysis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453103"],"title":"An empirical study on the interplay between semantic coupling and co-change of software classes","doi":"10.1145/3180155.3190833","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3190833","venue":"ICSE"}

The other advantages of this separation of the domain model from the application code include: (i) the provision of a consistent view of the application domain across multiple applications; and (ii) its use as a communication and learning aid. The application architecture also supports the separation of the user-interface issues from those of application functionality. We also present the development of a network editor application conforming to this architecture.","inCitations":["b0c86c91a1eca719b27cc1c6556718cb66e3df09"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=100325"],"title":"An Object-Oriented Software Application Architecture","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

For example, at Siemens, sixty percent of our business is strongly influenced by software and approximately fifty percent of all Siemens patents are software related. With more than 30,000 software developers worldwide and an expenditure of more than 3 billion Euros, Siemens is playing in the 'Champions League' of the world's leading software companies. But this fact is not well known because most of the software developed at Siemens is embedded. It's embedded in the products and solutions sold to customers, such as medical devices, automation controls, trains, automotive components, and even power plants. Yet a major part of the functionality of these products and solutions is defined by software.Because of the high cost of developing software, and because of its extraordinarily high business impact, optimizing the software development process has become a top priority at Siemens. Simplifying, standardizing and stabilizing development processes and measuring progress according to the CMMI of the Software Engineering Institute, Making better use of existing synergy potentials, for example by using cross-divisional software platforms and architectures, and Reducing costs by making structural changes, such as offshoring software development to low-wage countries and using the skills of different cultures, especially in rapidly-developing Asian markets.The three levers will be described in detail and examples will be provided. The presentation will emphasize the early phases of software development, particularly with reference to requirements engineering and the importance of functional and non-functional requirements. A simple metrics system to measure success in software development will be presented. The Siemens Software Initiative, a company-wide program specializing on software engineering and management at Siemens will also be described.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/2006/2832/00/28320030.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134289","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p30.pdf"],"title":"Optimization of software development","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134289","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134289","venue":"ICSE"}

This paperpresents a model which captures the intentional structure of a software process and its embedding organization, in terms of dependency relationships among actors. Actors depend on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be pe~ormed, and resources to be furnished. The model is embedded in the conceptual modelling language Telos. We outline some analytical tools to be developed for the model, and illustrate how the model can help in the systematic design of software processes.

Compared to traditional keyword lookup, natural language input allows greater flexibility and precision. This report describes such a help system, NLH/E, which answers questions formulated in English. Currently, it can process questions about a substantial domain: over 130 functions described in five chapters of the Common Lisp manual. NLH/E is built with a novel caseframe parser that operates with a thesaurus, case inheritance, and noun/verb phrase unifica tion. These features reduce the size of the grammer considerably, making it feasible to build realistic NLH systems. Statistical data about the grammar are included. NLH is a first step towards a reusability expert, i.e., a program that helps a client find reusable software components by engaging in a natural language dialogue.","inCitations":["4a9b500c78b0b076ff7daf61ed2320e58d5bebd9","20fd604e1cfc322518494082066d661c79ec50c5","94876aec2991ac01ab9b024fcd885ccc67874a07","6438dae8a7bbad467a0717ba1dceefe8af5f8089","7ac8128c5aad759917165025f0b5eda7b069303d","c5725a84ffa3ee4691cd2bfdc8ce60d34d234af0","8657793575c0aff6d505bed53af0ee7049941f4c","43dd962eaa4707e03a6c311672aab29eb286b95c","90ccdeaf22451fb85e277deca7a3e7e6c14f009e","31f9609fa7c84130a6729dff6d483037a25c7c08","c27c7523cfeb1ae645809847d1560732c4c5744e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74638"],"title":"NLH/E: A Natural Language Help System","doi":"10.1145/74587.74638","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/74587.74638","venue":"ICSE"}

Agile process models recommend Test Driven Development (TDD) as a key practice for reducing costs and improving code quality. The objective of this work is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of this practice. Previous work by Fucci et al. [2, 3] engaged in laboratory studies of developers actively engaged in test-driven development practices. Fucci et al. found little difference between test-first behaviour of TDD and test-later behaviour. To that end, we opted to conduct a study about TDD behaviours in the \"wild\" rather than in the laboratory. Thus we have conducted a comparative analysis of GitHub repositories that adopts TDD to a lesser or greater extent, in order to determine how TDD affects software development productivity and software quality. We classified GitHub repositories archived in 2015 in terms of how rigorously they practiced TDD, thus creating a TDD spectrum. We then matched and compared various subsets of these repositories on this TDD spectrum with control sets of equal size. The control sets were samples from all GitHub repositories that matched certain characteristics, and that contained at least one test file. We compared how the TDD sets differed from the control sets on the following characteristics: number of test files, average commit velocity, number of bug-referencing commits, number of issues recorded, usage of continuous integration, number of pull requests, and distribution of commits per author. We found that Java TDD projects were relatively rare. In addition, there were very few significant differences in any of the metrics we used to compare TDD-like and non-TDD projects; therefore, our results do not reveal any observable benefits from using TDD.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453184"],"title":"Analyzing the effects of test driven development in GitHub","doi":"10.1145/3180155.3182535","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3180155.3182535","venue":"ICSE"}

Existing methods have little requirements engineering support for system family development. This short paper proposes a requirements metamodel for system family development. Traceability throughout model elements is a necessary precondition for preserving the consistency of the complete family model during development and is a main issue in this paper as well as for software development in general. Family development based on the metamodel guarantees traceability by the inclusion of all development artifacts in a single and consistent model.","inCitations":["006c738f047abffe079a2ec8d1d4b9261ba5ee48","2c536fa61c2f781c9515694a9a6787e3b957a789","84ba77799777f2d708ffbcd9da0c0871f4f6ab22","ac6ce0babd322544ec28d2999ca45f25931dfe59","4abb2eca033b9e3565ab24701e69913508aa2636","153dc59db067ceb4899e79e6f12e002afb5467c2","3070a534bdf1169391f97219cbccbc5e0700a6d5"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919186","http://www.theoinf.tu-ilmenau.de/~streitdf/TheHome/own/data/ICSE.pdf"],"title":"Traceability for System Families","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919186","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919186","venue":"ICSE"}

This paper describes an alternative approach to software construction, Java Layers (JL), and evaluates JL and frameworks in terms of flexibility, ease of use, and support for evolution. Our experiment compares Schmidt's ACE framework against a set of ACE design patterns that have been implemented in JL. We show how problems of framework evolution and overfeaturing can be avoided using JL's component model, and we demonstrate that JL scales better than frameworks as the number of possible application features increases.

However, only a little is known about how users and developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate their privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements, we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 408 valid responses. Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more concerned about the content of their documents and their personal data such as location than about their interaction data. Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective. We also observed interesting differences between people from different geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific and Europe believe that content and metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America. Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal, technical, and commercial perspectives.","inCitations":["c556f148555db65a534c41a72a9ec0bece2802bf","25a20464586c7a75c417a207861f067f53297fc7","062bdfc36db140a507395a68dd0d39a3763c0aa7","4003c0fa24074cbd114d0cd853d87c5a1be42f86","ba8ef2baf70a40736d442a7a1dbd0a45a114b899","15dd40b2a4b1374a990dfc6bb47075c2b0eda751","69cfafd6ac6b75d3f945d708f6b2598dd4522d16","20704643278111342011c702aedf66c04a2c8e63","7295a65e91fe05bb629be3c216e280ac1b5f2873","5a86321bf451a86fb1ea11ac73eee21bd7c7f07e","a73bd1dff0c3718d438d56c19239ddfd2e8149e9","83199c9182951d6f77990ace7a7071286202d919","9c8619786b3938cc36c625ffb0fa331f499026cc","6d046fdeeed7a64c6e1e59df81d9394071450bdf","14baa5b0f9d356bcf239652af75e616c62c651a7"],"pdfUrls":["https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?format=pdf&techreportID=1551","https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568244","http://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings239/124.pdf","https://mobis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/privacy-requirements.pdf","http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:167856/CONTENT/cucs-024-13.pdf","http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~swapneel/papers/privacy-requirements-icse2014.pdf","http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/p859-sheth.pdf","http://www.psl.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/privacy-requirements.camera-ready.pdf"],"title":"Us and them: a study of privacy requirements across north america, asia, and europe","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568244","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568244","venue":"ICSE"}

The goal is for models to be intuitive and well-structured, yet fully executable and analyzable, enabling automatic synthesis of usable and efficient code in object-oriented languages such as C++. At the heart of the modeling method is the language of statecharts for specifying object behavior, and a hierarchical OMT-like language for describing the structure of classes and their inter-relationships, that we call O-charts. Objects can interact by event generation, or by direct invocation of operations.

The problems include large cost overruns, schedule slippages, inadequate performance, and inability to use the system as originally envisioned. One major reason for such lack of success has been the inability of the management of the organization or the development effort to understand the need for a total-system management approach. In particular, acquisition of software and hardware separately with the hope of integrating them later does not work in complex systems. This paper outlines a management approach to acquiring computer systems which encompasses the whole system, with emphasis on the software, from the initial concept formulation to the support of the operational system. Expected improvements in the development process and organizational implications of this management approach are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807692"],"title":"A Management Approach to the Development of Computer-Based Systems","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Ultra-large-scale (ULS) systems are socio-technical ecosystems of ultra-large size on one or many dimensions number of lines of code; number of people employing the system for different purposes; amount of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined; number of connections and interdependencies among software components; number of hardware elements to which they interface. The characteristics of such systems require changes in traditional software development and management practices, which in turn require a new multi-disciplinary perspective and research. A carefully prescribed research agenda was suggested. What has happened since the study results were published? This talk shares a perspective on the post study reality --- a perspective based on research motivated by the study and direct experiences with ULS systems. Linda Northrop is director of the Research, Technology, and Systems Solution Program at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) where she leads the work in architecture-centric engineering, software product lines, cyber-physical systems, advanced mobile systems, and ultra-large-scale systems.

This paper documents an attempt to provide an empirical metrics \"view\" of such initiatives based on data collected in a worldwide benchmarking effort conducted between March, 1991 and kcember, 1991. Surprisingly, of the more than 300 organizations that participated, fewer than 1 in 5 had any quantifiable performance data available prior to the start of this study. However, those that had embarked on significant process improvement efforts and were actively using metrics were able to demonstrate substantial gains in productivity and quality. In addition, insights derived from this large scale data analysis provide a framework for determuun ' . g which metrics should be included in a standard software engineering measurement \"dashboard\". Introduction Software engineering literature today abounds with discussions of CASE, I-CASE, object-oriented design and development, IPSE'S, and application of new workstation technologies. Howcvcr, at a more f i \"en ta l level bemeath the glitz and glamour of technology basic issues regarding the software engineering process and the people that make the processes work effectively are also being addressed. Even with all the resear& publication, and conference activities in both these domains three critical remain unanswered especially when considered from a quantitative or \"metria\" viewpoint : 0 To what extent are basic, sound practices actually being used and adopted by software engineering profdonals? 0 s o f f w a r e ~ g p e l f o ~ ? 0 Howcanadvanasatalllevels-processand technology be leveragad through rapid adoption b y t h e s o f t w a r e e n g h x i n g community? What is tbeir overall measurable impact on The aforementioned issues are brought into focus and highlighted by Ed Yourdon's controversial statements published in his April 6, 1992 COMpuTERwoRLD article[9] entitled \"Kiss U.S. coders Good-bye\". In it, the point is made that U.S. softwate engineering as a craft with the result that, from a global m v e , the U.S. is becoming noncompetitive. Perhaps the most signiticant observation in regard to the U.S. software engineering infrastructure made by Yourdon is: coders are fascinated with techwlogy and treat \"to the extent that productivity is influenced by common, rigomus use o/ a standardized methodobgv, I think Americans are at disadvantage \" The pivotal element in this quote is the concept of \"rigor\" and its relationship to software engineering performance andeffkchlxss. Rigor, as described in a dictionary, relates to \"strictness\", \"severity\", or \"discipline\". The latter definition provides a context for a discussion of rigor and software engineering practice and its relationship to process maturity. \"Rigor\" and software process maturity From a software engineering perspective, the start of the 1990's has been characterized by a renewed interest in software process, system development methods, life cycle models, and software quality. In 468 0270-5257/93 $03.00 6 1993 IEEE many ways, the U.S. software engineering community seems to be focused on the basic elements of \"rigor\" as evidenced by the widespread interest in the work of Humphrey[4] at Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute. In spite of this high level of interest, little is known the impact of software engineering practices and processes. While much is written about the topic in qualitative terms, little quantitative information is available. In many ways, the software engineering process is an informational \"black hole\" it draws in money and resources like a magnet but little data emerges. A worldwide data profile To shed some light on a global picture of what is actually going on inside the \"black hole\", a project was initiated in 1991 in which data was collected from organizations that participated in a worldwide software quality and productivity measurement benchmarking exercise. Almost 200 North American companies and 157 others worldwide were involved either formally or informally. Orgauizations that participated were distributed across the commercial and government sectors. Data collection was performed via questionnaire and/or site visits. The data collection questionnaire focused on a limited number of key areas : organization size; portfolio size; portfolio change (1 year); availability and actual use of selected tools and techniques; SEI level (if assessment performed); split between new development and support work; support work breakdown; typical life cycle work breakdown distribution; detailed data from up to 6 projects. Questionnaire-based data collection commenced in March, 1991 and concluded in December, 1991.A similar project was initiated in March, 1992 in which 8,629 professionals were contacted to obtain information about their software engineering functions. In the 1991 study, site visit data was obtained from more than 50 of the organizations in conjunction with consulting activities. Those responding via questionnaire also received phone calls to enable at least \"long distance\" data validation. In addition to covering a wide range of organization types, variations in size as measured by the number of software professionals ranged from a low of 22 to a high of 3200 across all the 1991 parttcipants. Data collection results From this activity many observations about the state of software engineering today, the impact of rigor, process maturity, and technology transfer were made. Most interesting are the observations that can be made about the data itself. Finding 1: : Fewer than 1 organization in 5 had information available relating to the \"size\" of their systems portfolios. Finding 2: : Fewer than 1 organization in 30 had information available relating to the \"flux\" of their systems portfolios. [\"Flux\" in this context is the absolute value of the change in portfolio size as measured by KLOC (thousands of lines of code), function points (FP), or MK I1 Function Points, over the period of 1 year.] Finding 3:: Fewer than 1 organization in 50 had idormation available relating to quantifiable aspects of software quality defect densities, failure intensity, etc. The paucity of \"portfolio level\" data was surprising considering that financial data was generally available. In hct, the lack of data is even more Surprising when the financial data[8] indicates that the organizations surveyed are spending up to 5% of their revenues on information technology. Perhaps one of the key drivers for the flattening of spending on information technology is that it is not clear where the money is actually going. Likewise in the U.S. corporate information technology community, there is a renewed thrust toward increased business alignment. The state of \"rigor\"\" The principle motivations for this study were : (1) to determine the extent to which sound practices and basic disciplines are being applied to software engineering, and (2) to determine the extent to which software metrics are being collected and used. In the context of \"rigor\" (process maturity) basic questions addressed were : 0 What is the value of increased process maturity?","inCitations":["023315a888fb7787d8c42093e1005d00e2c5cb20","5aedf9d34753ad01cdb826e6f8c0e62a03a9760c","ffa7a0f10bb3c933edd943353fcfe7b9c747d384","767a19ea1a5c7c14c6d89ba96ebb9b144d311ceb","2aebf5065dac6f364113b9a6bf37678502be11aa","00c6a8b9e3fa016e3435695a753e4ff1e022ab9f","14ce49632663e75cbe8aa4044f892df1889a78c3","1e7af2377568cb390c17433fd83a7a8d838edd5e","9f718154fd06b92f85e2184da793b9c0051e82b9","d10e1025f73567f23962f565ae614a45d68e2deb","360b4d71442b59fecae6fd3d47286b29a32fdb4a","49994ebdfdd2ba2493294460b85cc68efad0f7c4","c8ae4e55747bcfd0217b8ecefce5ecea1df2b2b2","99b1b5248ee2f8924433ade297defd5c8d7abb69","05799a393f3e969c97d552bf6b82fb0f57c5048a"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257572.257676","https://doi.org/10.1109/METRIC.1993.263806","https://csdl.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icse/1993/3700/00/00346019.pdf"],"title":"Software Process Maturity: Measuring Its Impact on Productivity and Quality","doi":"10.1109/METRIC.1993.263806","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/METRIC.1993.263806","venue":"ICSE"}

Specialists usually make security decisions, but program managers are left wondering whether their investment in security is well spent. This paper summarizes the results of using a cost-benefit analysis method called SAEM to compare alternative security designs in a financial and accounting information system. The case study presented in this paper starts with a multi-attribute risk assessment that results in a prioritized list of risks. Security specialists estimate countermeasure benefits and how the organization's risks are reduced. Using SAEM, security design alternatives are compared with the organization's current selection of security technologies to see if a more cost-effective solution is possible. The goal of using SAEM is to help information-system stakeholders decide whether their security investment is consistent with the expected risks.","inCitations":["2e1f501a2c120430e606f2a891be30d16ac5d436","f15bf5e3f83399df289724dfee8bf617eeebbe76","48f01470e1faf5e781886c045bc2a1fea05a669d","023d6e4fceebcf766f74068cb164926afb8b624a","9c6140cd4c591e3fd1949938ae20e50db3a5f96e","c9f0cc312bfbe8686f8d15bf916545fc6adc4d73","1a747d157877e05e077a95e5bc71e2913b7c5e26","6abec5a86969c877bceaa877dc70caf61354fb6f","dd86ac2c9c1ca1373f6a25d554a402a894f156fe","13e146f53afee8863efd9d99e068030427d776ca","89ce239ecd84656e79267a1acbc162a5e0d96bd2","33e174374b3c488c5d3f096bbac1f89cbcf80007","8f0392af3f18c9b6210caf75cac947b831457bdf","30233ae604bff6216598442d6e02ed2ff5e185cd","4a842d07231737c197df0ef9041580c3897765f2","1c911c755fb8898d0844a002b59554fa333ef025","2da7a152a28be3e9fd6857a2024ba7ad6f630455","679af9daa1592911dc9656ce668e24a55a94ca30","54c464f1e7be77774140e2b0744bca0c816cf235","37a1bca2218bbe9753a9cc3f81dbf91e0f68ccc3","095938d78116018b883fd367e415f54ff7b4d7ac","ce41ee155f45efa0df5fc65a58904b26877b849a","cb867a8f1db3694b73d2e884c75d704db54f5edb","604f65c38d79405a7b6351a9387dea352ee8e610","f03256c4a64aa2768c55c226748720d53cf12837","1ec83c923d216bfecde6f2d005665999d5691120","6ad63dc45d5e9d9f0a6fc2abd9f3999b532ee9e5","26c3a21196178a869e6d9da257b93c53ad578881","97c768a2b260e42132b1db017a758a8b5e08079e","7b1c4c37d7692f14ef025ad0f21dfba75b888d55","f3f2670f5ee45b82db8f333eab873b094654df16","f786b34d6aa7d83314a7307e59e4ab683131bf6f","1a1799d16bb2662f007414eb94fceb5507b81780","ea1bb2e9a997a854e4c1e8d1027423a49ad56626","4c5b347a984acb4de482f8531ce18a53baae924e","6e264c79dfe3ec446fa1ebd9539189f373229086","6df4735495edb9a1fbecfb38951d2a040dbfd5d2","92a92b9d69eb8d7e4d162d1feee2636cc6c60344","e55ccaeb8ff182d39059db14ae7abda3a8f2d4b3","95b6c5978a8dc295753b1c29cb4a33e24339687d","84d240783934c0c7591e528980e7e121008fd65e","d53e68011bde9eaf7bd94e6218339fd7cb646554","93ed309840be49f5cc40adcdb231f8abcd7697a6","ad148d786eb39d0aae04ef0617ab98464092ab06","ba7220e02ab4a16acc93374345579687fbdf1c0e","247069426afddcb1b057b16345a9a643e0163875","19d7a5bf2af705d7e0ad3aa9129ecb1b566722b7","02520efe5e902a45bc8459722e961cc06c2bd163","bffcb2d621745c98429dbbb6656111333a271bb3","ebe3c093784cd292d5ea437af12e310eb55f8917","9b6985203d0b4c60e54adfdbbefff41975d12dc4","ebde66feda95753e9632b0ba32a28c3e0b906bbc","f129966e9ab65a6a1a49f4ffa7d2c316d9e5827e","3a4689375c902b64531f6bd25b33ac81de352519","ecf12d14e4c365839bb87b890bb2f3b3f7607cff","8183186dcf4c89e7caf6ee1e657b4f4deeddd960","1bc55833179a0c7ce9dbaa99a0cd76c44cfb6cc9","06953c81902793c519d7ac764501f5e6b14fe8da","46a6f7ea2620a5789b22451ad3e8f5e555b7f13c","83a71b912ad0423e05fdaf685fb1af05b5ff2cca","322c8139640f556a86e35808982f080d58f02471","657ab50576e95dada330b9143a7307bc7713f971","8abbc3ffbe842b40ef1a6d14fa9a14c21ba278f7","7c383510549cc794ad7ecdaccbe92e9b95e20d08","40af7956dc1646cc93b3bf8785d4ca4d1dd06f04","8b1e3096a623bcdbbb485f3a6e7ec15efa318e24","9b34326aaad2ce13a46da34bbebcbb5fc54368fa","2b6747aa1bfcec97f21266494cce133acb5d1f52","2b69517f880f87d2013e82557e0b8f7b935123d9","3dc342566a881634c38e2b72297d1801504a6d11","ef1c3f162bd0353873ea8c7e5f20bd8bae896148","1e34ed2411c37847669fe99d877c11dcf8356631","28e34ec39ccb97c692299f561819be90b3b2276c","5b1a18364b46414f95d65eef2305f4296a30fe22","3609156c5036029b1985eb1aa7df789d58600e16","9c2a9838f2f115ee0cf2867776ce3884857da616","df10af2383b5ce2cef7fa3d7a85b419dabcd9590","f053aea021452e25da0c10298d75f81ec9e7dac9","730a02a2e00abdf7716bc26c19ad9f53734c75f2","af2d74101a3db0bde9e3f271311dddc30e8b9508","81aa3c425151755cf933e4d776372f9c7257fb0f","1bcede76056968b0c72a428605ad255cfb31e27f","ee0e7b5beed8bb5df9f75c5bad6c672d4e07ee3a","eecf6f15f8ad5fe4e0c38babde8012f28731580f","04f8f8ff17175664cb80b897d581ba8e505f8301","7ebce0cc9e6a7dbcb4851eac48b44aea87efc05e","8332106d4d76285bd38d6187cfc61953c482b73d","b41ccc88ed0b82d976b7707c5a73be61553a46ee","2296d5b3e8ba48f7e99aae8a02fbcb6bd2059e5e","1d5e8f0b5ca2de8140445dfcb250b83852287695","3d366da13d9f1232a5a124d14044b40bd4879e3d","a35699207b0a477af5ad0d0c5b448f3d3ca534ab","d57e3b5af1a34ef09f9159c8e0a03ca5498f0ca9","b8f22d75934240e58688b85781ab0c3bffd58fee","3d197771354294417d6e1e95d34221813aea9afa","9e7f8398df6d09485cc5a66e16f736a0ef6f5bdf","1b50b2bcd85c1881d86d2c43d095c0c3b750dcdd","305db423f80c7d8115208685538393ced68c55b4","3207ad3f386ab295adcfaf3bb74055900cd0f0d9","5e0cf60a9f6ebca551d5821fc8cb0e40364e3e2b","6cac76688a10b2ca6a823129d3b0c3a53c80608e","1ebfa4408086f266c0a6f848f6a60bb25c345b80","312a482f3bf46b2258df800d6cae6933b23cd56a","e448739782283468c2249cbf60a6f328c8f5f87f","539f5a2f85f381c34c5500f95e0ca522ff369e72","fda62fc7b0041dace9dddc243708dd0ecd8709b3","d042daef7d88f5919b652ea39dba981ef2cd177f","b855c31acedd45a0430dc62ce06715602addfce6","ffa3e3dd59746a2f845571c5df85f1a8cac27d4f","53a6ab45bbc2b4622f890a61acd22ea024875093","59eb014d727f9977b93fbea59835217ae7ba44bf","0af06546727caeb4bd0f2b8d441b7f2ac2524de0","2853ff2bbe1e11817e381c49b0fd81c1cd80245a","690c500fd914876467019a3311a4dc97083e91ac","9a55544dc201e44a1a83a2c792e6fd9ebf2d23b4","58c753ecc0cc128bbdaec2448a573d4

Due to everyday work, there is often no time or need for complete courses or textbooks on a broad topic. This challenge leads to multiple approaches like learning objects, micro learning and learning nuggets. Critical part of these approaches is to provide metadata to each resource in order to place the resource in context, enabling the learner to easily retrieve resources and the lecturer to reuse the material. Metadata definitions like LOM or IMS-LD are however defined on a generic level, suitable for education in general, without considering specific domain characteristics. Additionally, much of the available learning material focuses on acquisition of knowledge, rather than the empowerment to perform new tasks in the learners current situation. In this paper we present a preliminary model to describe the software engineering specific context of learning material that can be used to extend existing metadata definitions in learning management systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449479"],"title":"Situation-based e-learning in software engineering: using software engineering-related metadata to improve self-empowered learning","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195063","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195063","venue":"ICSE"}
