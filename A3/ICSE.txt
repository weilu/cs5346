The author's perspective is traced through an early emphasis on development tools and methodology to an emphasis on specifications and requirements to a broader emphasis on overall manageability. The evolving thought process is projected ahead and illustrated by some current efforts and activities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approaches to further enhancing the development process and the author's view on which areas should be given the main attention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803217"],"title":"A Perspective on Software Development","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Various types of software were developed, including real time applications, support, and hardware installation and maintenance. Two million instructions were developed at a cost of approximately five thousand staff years of effort. The objective of this paper is to document the staff resources utilized in this development. The actual development rates for the different types of software and the various factors affecting those rates are analyzed. Software productivity is shown to be a function of the type of software - logical, algorithmic, man machine, etc. Emphasis is placed upon total project productivity. The allocation of staff resources for the systems engineering, design, code and unit test, and integration activities, which had an approximate percentage distribution of 20, 20, 17, 43, is analyzed and characterized.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807693"],"title":"An analysis of the resources used in the SAFEGUARD system software development","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

However, previous studies that investigated the correlation between code coverage and test suite effectiveness have failed to reach a consensus about the nature and strength of the relationship between these test suite characteristics. Moreover, many of the studies were done with small or synthetic programs, making it unclear whether their results generalize to larger programs, and some of the studies did not account for the confounding influence of test suite size. In addition, most of the studies were done with adequate suites, which are are rare in practice, so the results may not generalize to typical test suites. \n We have extended these studies by evaluating the relationship between test suite size, coverage, and effectiveness for large Java programs. Our study is the largest to date in the literature: we generated 31,000 test suites for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. We measured the statement coverage, decision coverage, and modified condition coverage of these suites and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness. \n We found that there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. In addition, we found that stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite. Our results suggest that coverage, while useful for identifying under-tested parts of a program, should not be used as a quality target because it is not a good indicator of test suite effectiveness.","inCitations":["f8d4dcd66d584fc03acb28d49230c53ec0d0db93","598b6edd197c644452130dfe1c04cdcd3e4ce189","6fd22a42faea3f99b66f709a03dbe1bbc3bcca2a","bb8296ea3304f2e1e11f564b7c165cfc69c404fd","9c406f9ef1b8b42b3bde8cbbdbe149cccceb27f5","0ee57b6c5399849a0f84f822b9564db6e470f90d","326733bb359a930e08ae3f9358e990f37bf96a12","ee4adca156f8420906407af830c0d8eb08aceb81","1e66ab12901114529d7b68a4b75d20f769e409b8","8dbd2a988a6fd754b06ebbe0bfce3ff2c41df13b","6a9dc95cf047bd8cc2c6622ac083156290e8b9b2","47d774431f0901a552c057b13c9e7a0f1f04f205","ed29a464b218fa6501f23fea96e0233389073240","178a226a4fa68d80f709d0cfff5f5458df0daad3","251676d6e9dc3cbe564a48f99ed58b2119c5ced9","62172675b3280348a83977a4c33ba0c5ac3d22de","c9e88f9eab9896d867f3cecfae3ee2f6e86966a9","3a6e90f11b4c7639f5b053d03fbf0f75cb808c0b","a81cd5b1f341878b43ce5bc20fa0037fe1843548","75f9495c90c21f5e8d156e6d15e132a817d3ccc5","123e5e7d1625d8e711dbde4645afd23515d75ce8","85d257f92815250f6823ba292488a8e1fc9ad7d7","d27ddedffe3b2e807d1b2e0d357810c38da83e79","411db1997482997f10193396efdf4339322b179d","1f18371b111d3f19fa46a143d0ec54fe52f5fecc","30b69310b69ceaf99e3b6e80a0edeca34d783e4a","0e8b45af88f516911e11896998d8b943543254fc","d56a337f206d6f770f098f277a600de1abdf1ea7","10bff32e6e7983fc413b6151105b76fb40e2f016","10851c21cf60c92877eb354f2dbd4e92ed839de6","f6f24e2e7d74b2dd804c31c3cd64a9c9356dc9e1","f464250c01a38411e58ba206b939a399534c506c","f6eb9c26c146dfe7af1b0e18f97d429485355b81","b16acebb947e28e77c3fc5f7a4de16d6df29eb4e","facc0d99048cf79576e62f3c92e1a0d4c1fdcc05","9ba82dcbc2f4b4c7e31daf34e085b7566e46707e","ea99f2d2008e3152c5aafd698be6fa225c8ba4ea","461306e66dd01bb22fa70ecb4b6964b798a48461","cb6e79583e365099897e069fbe245152fc960a94","6911ce24b5c7a1d4060dbdaa675cded8b7b71239","7370bff63e50f9981f3559bd8c873a951c3e3b20","45551117aae172e7520dc1073413ee2f648c9442","5bd7a128fe7e1c23a5a75bcb66c3891d69187b7b","f178cfca42c44c0da62269a747b7b610fb3734c3","3781752d4db95c5de1dced9b02c749dd96533c71","8b2dae33373cb5f657a13aad7cf340ffbf559349","acb856db7b9735ddb537248bcfa167f2167c2c5d","fab20f18746cc99eacede50568f77cded38408e0","a7d2b923b4f3afc3413652eb45d526fe31846c26","42eee87906cc514945c8c11c9c4db82cd874e46e","e08097c55ad7a9ea74beeec149015b8ce0c75310","6c6ed3fbb20b2fa23de3d239592cc8ee81dc5234","3a853c142911dd48a9d87a2e48bb9ac2320f4a20","b3a60ebdefa9620619515f986aa4fb7f6f04f37c","2d84b23d6b146b6e9a9a2b11991dd4356d50a490","1ceba9966e2e0b2b6e0b5d87f82c7f59c1086150","2be6dc596fd0415d4281364df5a65ec327e369f8","8da1f886c4962b993bb8ccbb27c061048c230803","23ca9d0217896259ebd4c4b612ced01a75bc6e86","dfef66b828ab797aa78bd577c38a40e2ce4f44e6","4d850fa0d11c00a8d8ba602b7bb379a832f7dc71","0dc2d0b78baf6786dfbc7911657c8536846fddc4","406206211dfc10c6bca84c095c7a0ca5dde76d64","719a8b62c4902d40590ab0f262c817bb567d8f3c","33fb105ac0c23705d61ab891572487c03ec71de1","dff958a245934df65051f381df4d95631a4f017e","1ede6af4a4037e33cec2053bf3873d2edbf6721f","dbdceb03c86e3cd9b80336b22367960fc1461649","1d22ff36a6d349606e5de839e79f2b4db6ca491a","b2e9bae3fbfe43cdbeb13c365695ccaa42c21da8","6ebc45e1ecd0fe4e07f93680dc000f91f7de74b6","22d2c1349904e41f93e01f4255b711913a0ca4b3","c182438493e570914f5857f14ba7cdf488827eeb","3e6535461fc556d2536de4a308c40617cf47a182","4061f9d58444e613c819d72e23e5a4387cd105b1","8924a32c1b0769b1d523739217fe07c876571700","769676e6e8626da478e1da967e72ae92534ac525","222c96474165dead8b9a3322a22d3c466463ba57","c6c7465754adb61cd83639aa2269272f01086fae","4c255070c141d2176b9d197ebb585591af02ad99","0c6b1fe0db0abb4f7d94d2fe23268e5218aa2e69","ed6560b3ebb8aa2a4e64848d50097da309f9d886","e5a4e01bb7daa635e62597f383d210699c55fa2e","642fb2cdcd5b02a97d08f06a9dbff9829f63a5c0","3120b5c8311b04f8aeae65849b5f536988cc9435","764f3787691c0df39d84e5e3b143a21858b6e84c","9a40d64982385ca1c4bab144dd4649c4d74d6715","69cb8756a4cf02c7ebe248f2be7360824952bcff","3e4be19e71dcccf87d3a6340dc54bfa369f1ac2f","66b7ed2c9a43eec163ecf4cf1fad94dd7e8d3a3a","50f16096476e3fd267762449e126c948f0d02e59","634f24ab1f7632e3414501c142c9eea58bf3bd1f","fedafef5fae6643634bf73a391bc6baf5c6c169b","20d3466d7e81b506028e08653a39592574041f72","45d50ea0610fff50ca179823055b153910672deb","c764afe6f7f792b42499ff6a6a46f920ca7ea325","bf7e48b8a4e64d1307e63a3147b94f7ea1c4289c","bef2a8f1361054fe3a8e3b80a83e55187d5a8db4","1719456589ebec1029eedeadb5cbd859d5608030","ebb961c138a6b9a556aec443b1f3b7f77843d521","07997cd00f2d6e5470527ca1615911177d93eb10","16dba59f23b07f55e117e996ee507fbab00e4772","00eaffdf95b5298b59dd6988ca8f8af97054a39c","d4885dfea472a776acf9d87296e27c06db484210","29033096b6ea405f53964e816ef668a06ec8ac80","acdd754e14760315f5c415ba724c3f36c7bd043c","77f0d114725b2e4d2f7ffec510f314d72ee2a853","2911f88215ee611ed631b8b50c7700454942813c","e3bdf828aa7a1367c66c9863d787011d2e45a5ec","0f6bec8f9edc4260f51ef69f26346c1314466b61","7c8947d98a263359e01b768d86e59f4ddd50fb73","577f17ecdddb4bc3e922e3c9dfcfddcccfb6eac7","1f07f1abb60d860e31cccfab3faa357fcf1fcc69","d6111d4597c106fcc6625f083c50154dad122995","a0845161c1f2e078d7669386511dd45369b8f35a","306ebef28c125e1d1ab39ce

Application development for mobile platforms opens an additional area of qual i ty-power consumption. In PDAs or mobile phones, power consumption varies depending on the hardware resources used, making it possible to specify and validate correct or incorrect executions. Consider an application that downloads a video stream from the network and displays it on the mobile device's display. In the test scenario the viewing of the video is paused at a certain point. If the specification does not allow video prefetching, the user expects the network card activity to stop when video is paused. How can a test engineer check this expectation? Simply running a test suite or even tracing the software execution does not detect the network activity. However, the extraneous network activity can be detected by power measurements and power model application (Figure 1). Tools to find the power inconsistencies and to validate software from the energy point of view are needed.","inCitations":["6ab716a4d09ff601578b04277c8382b6c6f0740d","0d42a3a6c31f005d173fc6851bb02695bb820ad4","79d474d9d0e026aac162f979a4559806cc9bfac9","aa0c0aa667de832921df88ef91b9407020590d52","b14c7b200c258474a19abce9e93b7bae583b101e"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0201028v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0201028v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.SE/0201028","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581460"],"title":"Software validation using power profiles","doi":"10.1145/581339.581460","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581460","venue":"ICSE"}

Control concepts are abstract notions about interactions between control flow, data f70w, and computation, eg. %ead-process loop99. They are recognized by comparing a language independent abstract program representation against standard implementation plans. Recognition is eficient and scalable because the program representation is hierarchically decomposed by propers (single entry/exit control jlow sub-graphs). A recognition experiment using the UNPROG program understander shows the method’s performance, the role of proper decomposition, and playfulness in a sample of programs. As an example of the method’s applications, we describe how recognized control concepts are used to perform Cobol restructuring with quality not possible with existing syntactic methods.","inCitations":["e072bde758c675ead06ccf12daffa3ca22c0a9e6","816d4909989fa628041d519eaafe6a7c66c3e44e","765dc0d8f6c62350352220175a79c5657426a986","de4198e96cae5d7066db3b914f0b0c7fc4d9920a","e6a943d75f0570f6199d3290fa53e00c45835106","2b2c7b4c7b0768ea044a15f7b09d1513026b2992","7fbc4e371668f9cfee7b99baf6d8ddaaa234c49b","08cbdab384308b072e8b298644ea5b084ced40ac","44916279e69cb149c84b0f0618a751ae73707b8a","651416e452cf4160fca8b7042e2957325dd781c1","5442844a31e7d49cece769a942d5370e81e5262d","f88b61c8bd60e3faabbee27a1ee6cc12d6cf93b1","a3b0ff9f2e8425ab013b856c41ffac72faf3873f","d812af5bc2e5a1a9a89f3ed0ff0b91d1f85124ff","a7dd718c19d63512f9f06e424de6190468cd6f43","9f64046d8ae29c485f22a0f8a286aa6b58f9e298","1d2aef1c0757adb9c209dd672d34841182c4e375","c5700c1b259312ade09d9eccc853a4f22fc9ca98","2fb84559d9083cfd3f36883d07bc7fef3650a398","f5b6b39cbf827baacafe5cb55365732ad7465437","0c53687d9215abe39e91d980e459b50a78614d8b","d04a82e7e181a0315f4c7fd6c6d9f7d2fa11054d","cbc5eaf4995813fa1401f5ad932202650b95338a","6caf2ee79a27f0f7dc9b160de07be2db00457331","12819551ec19d7da5f8e6fede36a935c4df26264","d3e756e5c81d6dc5867b93cffd26b09fd78c492a","102aea8581c2ece19c44014ae19b04bb63ad63a6","93968a0adc5a0a2eae732ee47ff3a353db09964b","9d710018767e8740a340fd2a78ef1f767eda919e","ba5aad2ec7564b2cf13080d1ffd14d8ccfe98465"],"pdfUrls":["http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=256664.256684","http://swunderstanding.com/icse-paper.pdf"],"title":"Understanding Natural Programs Using Proper Decomposition","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

Browsers expose semantic and syntactic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relationships are derived using tools which perform static analysis on the original software documents. Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strategies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right browsing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant crossreference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive coding for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using existing static analysis tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed software projects. The chime framework provides a flexible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into software documents using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the chime specification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for software documents, into an existing, legacy software development environment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI. This paper describes the chime architecture, and describes our experience with several re-targeting efforts of this system.","inCitations":["693e11f86ae7bbd1b45f482da8602f214594e67c","60c0b2d68a9956e5c37107f2c4c4a5021f05cc47","90e2cf98c008d1280b4541b08a062b08a31ea918","2b58bd3497a90b69d3b19f7e1dc394c7246d235f","cd7177f2c0a1b2ad7465b870becaaa7190b752da","ed865ed216be68eef480e3906566c9c77eee7dde","09a230c7f0fca40a48b8f2070b6f8b6d44ae29ae","2ee181d793477e93acb1ac476e1ce6ddca86746b","e1edf3581e776a0943be4c9ac7f629ee86091ac0","53027ee722525b0c567927637cc84b8f01dbe529","e178f20011130776da99a083c17a6dedd2c61dc9","5740b000bff6af5ad5296e529ef01942b23db4b5","024a0ed61583e3e4c5c3cb6a8d5cc01c627a2de2","7ae5beab13ea691e3feb8571d419c64a2e6d9e66","0253d04c573d905b0dd2b0656a77e88cfe6cf97a","3d798b253b08f3645eb6f5b092b2219b25df6ca6","888c7922feb6a894e6140ac2f9e955d79291f85c","9f57f90bdcf5340e5fcfed78587c0f803661d490","9d8a6cb73e1959fac87942f2c1dc1f0c4f477893","ab02b80f482c3c34f85bd8e26ac38512dd6f7dc9","88c3d2bdce91430d24ed847086e115ae31c332e0","1d9edd257352711f57f6f3d67d721024fe15665a","60f8c05408545ce242f1ca0dd4b39bbcfde0e0af","5ba259b5df17f00c3cd09514f38eec6fa0ab8048","6ab322d8257edbb9ad4f4859b0112d2bbe1af5f4","4c12bf7749dc121a9b3928aaf835b45f329fad6b","68aef4f0e82336a9f3f24465f3335585828d3184","026f7c658fb51bac92d360a93f4b9943e506a771"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302679","http://castle.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","http://www.research.att.com/~chen/chen/chime.ps","http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/papers/pdfs/chime-98.pdf","http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~devanbu/files/chime-98.pdf","http://www.research.att.com/areas/visualization/papers_videos/pdf/DBLP-conf-icse-DevanbuCGMM99.pdf","http://www2.research.att.com/~erg/pdf/DBLP-conf-icse-DevanbuCGMM99.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emden_Gansner/publication/2632058_CHIME_customizable_hyperlink_insertion_and_maintenance_engine_for_Software_Engineering_Environments/links/02e7e517afa9ac85a4000000.pdf"],"title":"CHIME: Customizable Hyperlink Insertion and Maintenance Engine for Software Engineering Environments","doi":"10.1145/302405.302679","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/302405.302679","venue":"ICSE"}

Model checking is considered to be the broadest used formal verification technique, even though a great quantity of computing resources are needed to verify medium-large and large systems. As verification is prevent over the whole software process, these amount of resources is more critic in incremental and iterative life cycles. Our proposal focuses on reusing incomplete models and their verification results —which are obtained from a model checking algorithm— in order to improve these kind of life cycles. Making good use of these previous verification results can reduce the formal verification costs by minimizing the set of requirements and the set of system states where the properties must be verified.\nThe unspecification inherent to incomplete systems is used to provide an approximate and content-oriented retrieval which is supplemented by suggestions to match the desired specifications.","inCitations":["5da168c2a43c1056c9686c44251203c1063de45a","819b1cf5aa29a80a569baff362932bdd9cab65f8","8a0d023e93145b76c900df4240ccadb499348023"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185"],"title":"Reuse of Verificatino Efforts and Incomplete Specifications in a Formalized, Iterative and Incremental Software Process","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919185","venue":"ICSE"}

When goals are assigned to an agent, they have to be operationalised: the agent’s operations have to be refined, by equipping them with appropriate enabling and triggering conditions, so that the goals are fulfilled. Goal operationalisation generally demands a significant effort of the engineer. Although there exist approaches that tackle this problem, they are either informal or at most semi automated, requiring the engineer to assist in the process. In this paper, we present an approach for goal operationalisation that automatically computes required preconditions and required triggering conditions for operations, so that the resulting operations establish the goals. The process is iterative, is able to deal with safety goals and particular kinds of liveness goals, and is based on the use of interpolation and SAT solving.","inCitations":["e83f2a143b061d63fca6e267ffe2f899f3dbda2e","a44afa0f820c7825a490727ae8ee787d77ed1fc2","6cbb40d4ddebecb756341a6350d56add94ab213f","d3b739f5acf1eb728808773dceac344391da9b08","2dbe44387c6142050af0432e2c0643bb86721de8"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2568225.2568323","http://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar/staff/rdegiovanni/files/ICSE2014.pdf","http://publicaciones.dc.uba.ar/Publications/2014/DAAU14/Automated%20Goal%20Operationalisation.pdf"],"title":"Automated goal operationalisation based on interpolation and SAT solving","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568323","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568323","venue":"ICSE"}

An important aspect of this template structure organization is that like instances of a data structure allocated at runtime share a common template rather than each allocated instance of a data structure having its own individual template. The motivation for sharing templates is derived from the fact that large numbers of data structures can be active at runtime, and templates can occupy a considerable amount of storage (in some instances a template can occupy as much or more storage than the data structure elements themselves). The importance of template sharing in a paging system, and the capability of the template structure for facilitating the design and implementation of general operations such as insert and delete are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=807713"],"title":"The Design of a Template Structure for a Generalized Data Structure Definition Facility","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

PICFI starts with the empty CFG of a program and lazily adds edges to the CFG during execution according to concrete inputs. However, this CFG grows monotonically, i.e., invalid edges are never removed when corresponding control flow transfers (via indirect calls) become illegal (i.e., will never be executed again). This paper presents LPCFI, Live Path Control Flow Integrity, to more precisely enforce forward edge CFI using a dynamically computed CFG by both adding and removing edges for all indirect control flow transfers from function pointer calls, thereby raising the bar against control flow hijacking attacks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8449497"],"title":"Live path control flow integrity","doi":"10.1145/3183440.3195093","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3183440.3195093","venue":"ICSE"}

An important step towards an engineering discipline of software is a formal basis for describing and analyzing these designs. In this paper we present a theory for one aspect of architectural description: the interactions between components. The key idea is to de ne architectural connectors as explicit semantic entities. These are specied as a collection of protocols that characterize each of the participant roles in an interaction and how these roles interact. We illustrate how this scheme can be used to de ne a variety of common architectural connectors. We provide a formal semantics and show how this leads to a sound deductive system in which architectural compatibility can be checked in a way analogous to type checking in programming

Many GUI programs share the Web's notion of browsing through data- and decision-trees. This paper compares the user's browsing power in the two cases and illustrates that many GUI programs fall short of the Web's power to clone windows and bookmark applications. It identifies a key implementation problem that GUI programs must overcome to provide this power. It then describes a theoretically well-founded programming pattern, which we have automated, that endows GUI programs with these capabilities. The paper provides concrete examples of the transformation in action.","inCitations":["c3f8688242f1016d1733e1834c378c693058d5c4","5248d7603aab867bf5b773165b9ab84c7f3af7ed","81477106f4b0688e1f873d3c71371fca381ba96a","a8cd528fb4fdcd5dcf590060b3ee78d40cb43d6e","19f65a7bc2dcce1e99fabdf7cdbc305ff1117801","2a484dd8ef47ffd835154a61575a5560e0bc5062"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://cs.brown.edu/people/sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/icse2002-gk.pdf.gz","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/icse2002-gk.ps.gz","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Graunke/publication/221554072_Advanced_control_flows_for_flexible_graphical_user_interfaces_or_growing_GUIs_on_trees_or_bookmarking_GUIs/links/0912f511149bfd7e87000000.pdf","http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gk-gui-cont-flow/paper.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581375","http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/PL/paul.pdf"],"title":"Advanced control flows for flexible graphical user interfaces: or, growing GUIs on trees or, bookmarking GUIs","doi":"10.1145/581339.581375","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581375","venue":"ICSE"}

Crucial safety properties have to be guaranteed for all potential structural configurations. Testing cannot provide safety guarantees, while current model checking and theorem proving techniques do not scale for such systems. We present a verification technique for arbitrarily large multi-agent systems from the mechatronic domain, featuring complex coordination and structural adaptation. We overcome the limitations of existing techniques by exploiting the local character of structural safety properties. The system state is modeled as a graph, system transitions are modeled as rule applications in a graph transformation system, and safety properties of the system are encoded as inductive invariants (permitting the verification of infinite state systems). We developed a symbolic verification procedure that allows us to perform the computation on an efficient BDD-based graph manipulation engine, and we report performance results for several examples.","inCitations":["3ce6a9ae6b4bfb8ce13d0fd8ccb995d059088d88","a46230a34fe74912943445b80dba12a93e6bb362","3e5ad9540aafd24df392d0960d82ff281cac4d0e","fe8afeb731e911b7ceb89beb4c477b3ac95050f8","b63c9a6d9d113dd73564bd43324037cb18bcb668","627c72830018345a06566439fe626e45d44807fd","a31ddad8fae200bb49737e4dd0f74065ecd717b8","7932d8b39e6d176d856ace25c05f9158211662af","4c63a968387390d77e55d7dfb9c5888ce560a2fe","15f44429e80a21141f2e69d18c9e7d46a54f9ddd","99d9b9e18118e71a535ac84a459a5f48f9f17625","ba2c3482b2b03939b6ba357aa29bf24988f24fd2","10aac4932648f7e0d7b7bdb0156f65e238be1997","98f7009f4ef6f536fdf2acd03079eb7948753198","efb177475195815083634576ccf50372a0bf80fc","74962d2514f76f12b8539157c96c0297ff79fc9a","bec00aca1344dcf6b8176ed3fde789ecf7f4a8ce","9d57bd246c3e9b9e81128018c68ea2a5b080f28a","4f3ccb02de77cb418b993cb801cbe26202f32a02","a9854e490786947ba603e740e3691cfec55b48e7","2df7c219034a890a395591f1b183a997cbce93d8","2d614ae475a7c675d62b71b28df3247cb09e7a3d","00be8dc8fcf9e3623f3026c1d08b75680d13a476","9b930e349f8526da88d0325ffdc10a500006dc3a","3541de25f47e21afb3088e92f3b3d5d27bab1e52","b6540ee249962191f4ce7cfb6d7d9fd6ff98537e","08573bcd34af3d7def27e49b61b324e85485bd1f","9fb5f5ae46fe7133bd80bd068b31b6ebadbe8282","93d0b3381bc367490706a4cbb347a93d2e9e23a4","ede92f6f152814324c2acbf20fcaf6f723495930","be839fd15b7e6a8613e20ed42831c3a9d90f55ff","76d54613dd129aee59144ca601e9dbca4e6faf51","24f4bac812bef13f5552c7dbf3c58bf692f0492e","03c1723c3cf881acfe7a28777c3cf08d7f6ac7cc","6f831c1e415c18c1df94b18bb64d235beb3f9112","115045e0f551aa57b751c1c1910b8bd3348b82f0","067583c58c9e4cc4ff374ae1324ebd22e4e0de38","af6d4ba6352f993a456f7ebcb1e0439ae668fa41","837b9ec682d817f166fbc94ed6bd7c1016c8a82f","9b51663cb52d77515d0fec8b19585e6cf346d1e1","23376219845dd0aef9e2b558ad4e155d36606b25","c167191bbd00423c653aa118cec720d42af8cc6d","336bdb4fc8aabbdf15e6ac559020f72489d91761","d325900e92e7d81c59fc03d33e218c16ab4346cd","4dae47702a12090f2f5ea1ca32618c4f7a1d6880","dcbb1923f530bb739b043cf0d4a6589f186a0c3f","d710d0c4d71b49dbad4c0d8823d2b1d0c22cc29a","9b2c16753882ef31ee4f2197de6d231f425fe9d9","0bd9fbfc39bc64f21529fdd0f14e8b2f04c27b1b","781f0885afe6a9e7a5c3c6ed8ab1203b35059a41","8c290052b166d4db233d78bc2a8b376f0448c70d","07bec50d9ff90d1f69091bc95471a23f880c058f","3123442e9384878bd7790cb7a74a41754f1635bb","9d710018767e8740a340fd2a78ef1f767eda919e","eb62cf5246a446d3a4e90ed13828c464a1492852","57ab630eb7eca61b3e820c50c46e878effdf007e","990e921d16d733202412808500cf975088b8707f","d3dbb5cc2949f99abe22b239a61e6a8f463b48ab","02afb4276810695a3e54197c175f46a15f01def4","f12911e7bdd7a0868d9d084a502ebc1bd56de53a","d675511201335d6848a09e5a70b27dda279a3c72","3db456048d0cad524d7e4ce073b9ca7a1980b95c","c3ba0f4b93d31a1e058985f5449edbcf5adf96c0","7e13e143659fef8227e410dc279f10c6fb4f1f29","05237186be2776d0a33ca93132eaaffd39ac037b","fac1b561302c3d3a2c425708006c93f8ea66f465","7fdeb32f567e18f0258507c8cdfc5d8054289ba3","b2d27100b824a2bb9e625ea6708583381a69db18","d444b4f3b9b521a47f9abd0b4449b2c24bee3ba8","45886362a8445075b3c15cf9563a11e2bbe91c44","6560e2064592495f8894b7de937741b757314756","c819dc34cc722f6f94506002860cea9305d2b586","627765744b107e94650c6dd02ef1c77724c3b08b","7da9540739e117dcf89e20cac062cf1f120bfb41","42e1f3014bdde00fbf10943599891699a246b422","fee5958f3e8fb9e6698ced81f1ec7bd531791c31","5b0b5cccd82e457a450c81bd08eea7e025baa270","49a80c3fd0ddbd5d2bed4ca3ea0f814b47a7d401","08b4440f517af4aa1d205c2403b4c49d07082ec2","55ff693d78fd6d97a38736e7f1ddb9e44d4d3ad3","f928dbc2e346cf375545a13e355057cfc7f105eb","0dc387faad5e889eece0f8e872e1b6ee08653128","ce02ba73b00a97c63bd7608f3af1bd997f1360a6","4bf9799972e5d832db797df17aaada5c45078c88","bfa9b324c1b14934b67b62fd5cf49dee05aa7704"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.sosy-lab.org/research/pub/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~dbeyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134297","http://www2.cs.uni-paderborn.de/cs/ag-schaefer/Veroeffentlichungen/Quellen/Papers/2006/icse2006.pdf","http://mtc.epfl.ch/~beyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/daniekro/classes/se-sem/ss2007/papers/yury/Symbolic%20invariant%20verification..p72-becker.pdf","http://www.sosy-lab.org/~dbeyer/Publications/2006-ICSE.Symbolic_Invariant_Verification_for_Systems_with_Dynamic_Structural_Adaptation.pdf","http://www.irisa.fr/lande/lande/icse-proceedings/icse/p72.pdf"],"title":"Symbolic invariant verification for systems with dynamic structural adaptation","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134297","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134297","venue":"ICSE"}

To avoid committing irrevocable tasks followed by exceptions, B2B processes, which guarantee the atomicity sphere property, are attractive. While atomicity sphere ensures its outcomes to be either all or nothing, conflicting local recoveries may lead to global B2B inconsistencies. Existing (global) analysis techniques however mandate every process unveiling all individual tasks. Such an analysis is infeasible when some business parties refuse to disclose their process details for privacy or business reasons. To address this problem, we propose a process algebraic technique to prove, construct, and check atomicity-equivalent public views from B2B processes. By checking atomicity spheres in the composition of these public views, business parties can identify suitable services that respect their individual and overall atomicity requirements. An example based on a real-life multilateral supply chain process is included.","inCitations":["4def5671c1a0f261e68bc27233d243c6ade8788c","57147efbcf6ea172c7742f10dd054464b3dfe73b","3d3e46c47a097d1f002d405821e1b27deaa7c4ed","0fd49277e7ad0b0ef302f05ebcca772d28e34292","0e798e1b9a19ebf46ff8230293a9a7fc0c9b6970","fd5362f163321ad9f3c1b7dcb090cfac98e09a2e","d5744b9be475f7655e94b0d420f44500d773ea41","1f3df1c78785a4e17869cfd57177a9a12937d263","5f9010c0bc97f3e350ed56e69738c4c5bee07d25","4a0e96c1ca3a1bb619dfff6bacb969df1ff48901","1a716bf99f76f120d3efe87d62b5c24d5e21173f","ce8640ef0f90be23c6b66729ac43629dc4904047","1e7dc1b8833a2b21a54bd5d155eb67e16d9aa2c9","6f6bc6af0324a5fc63ee1939b4351105bf94c509","f08375d3f57278ff97a3e398b4fdc08a67dd2d20","b3e8f25d0858d5d111b5d382816cda3b5a2b23a1","7b4db1f6bd6044a2994a885cae0de892b9e21ea2","47e8757f7f9569b2c17c375c07818d3cccbbac92","51bc65ffa9775ddffea32271614d2330a90f579f","1549062634f368fc59cff6cb0c016766492115f1","abb905715550422141694c618544f62d249453ef","2aa1aaaf41925904cd3a9b5b931775fbd14430ad","2aea4d4bdbc29b38448ce4966a4758d1225d5c19"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/papers/icse06-ye+cheung+chan.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chunyang_Ye/publication/221554158_Publishing_and_composition_of_atomicity-equivalent_services_for_B2B_collaboration/links/0deec5180d8b4cb477000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134335"],"title":"Publishing and composition of atomicity-equivalent services for B2B collaboration","doi":"10.1145/1134285.1134335","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1134285.1134335","venue":"ICSE"}

We describe the design, execution, and analysis of the expem”ment so others may reproduce it and test our results for diflerent kinds of software developments and different populations of software engineers.","inCitations":["52e5526731300e97a97cd6e0d5460f4c961b940f","5149002061a59fe2c993373e6e012d35e111c639","7da816d0f1d2a2b33d6512a1e694c04cbe4d4963","acdede88f2827a8aad5945538b30ad643170a6e8","306b711cc4e20782c21d16ab4c3e8c71622842eb","07553b809551f463a226eb813a0a119b246dbb6c","451cdb11f22dad8321f5075c66e52cc32047c32b","30b30b2da89e9a287f235cdec1d346de163e50c5","c63c35894b93fe74f4518751a1ca38ab80512a72","22e5e0983824342959b2a627ee54062b0cd4e1d4","6c232f41439101668bd9be8a9d38b088f1621566","4b57016284e27819ae02954bd05720a6b5a4f438","738af5fe157f4ce39f3a3554db8cda02af0a9131","dc8de9350f6bea2b08465a5fcf853a060cda6b8b","cb23dfc0f607e5dc2c64676213320baa92d883fb","a017bc5d72eb789692e34e87c0ed75d15b941939","addeba398c9e9b882ce94c903c57b74f3646b92f","2cc27a92a3f1348de7d3447706fc2bf7b674a598","b245b233798afd7bbaf64b0102a4f2c45a660669","768862fa4b9201b867250725c85b6ca1354e0778","1015ceea2997701b3c74d32d9d5950a57ea600a6","c10e485183af46aa6639879d41ceffe98c134023","10a4222334165a758c800a79ed746a8210969d30","fa1b15b38c34695926dfe806fafc5a1b80cdbcfc","72c506a6b0a1f77f06f6ed1275221db367c6aac2","6783f8d4020e7e263bf5616c263aa80f5e89b66f","eb794459d9c980a0af39e26f99a4442ed4d85241","0458edc90b6a4fbcc351d9ba16e89b9fe08c3d49","a20f5415ee7d771aac7c50b28523c963de7a3245","17de8a46aa89924870f9beeb28bdbe9033482972","9efae273d9213b46254116e3a68fcd6ffe0debdf","9323e28f1a2139bd291e8bc3e248432d13f5666b","fc2cff71aa7b6147618e83a16e6b5e384acbe26f","3a6bf8316149cb57791e3f40450e0d2231e59f4e","919694869a997ba2a4a9d43473a62d3fe6065e42","8cee8b7db053ea80f6b472e60180ecd926abe9f2","86a4daaee147bfcfd90b7996f1fb3dd9e336708c","b0bfc79524415fb18cf8f56673f5b7218925769b","68f660790f29dba84dd5cfdbf0ed9f66060fb0ac","01afbdd9dae109d199a204315ed24d7a8055b75f","89d4f0afd2a4b8a68b3f40093894287689056133","21fe4bb6972bbee893a3e2383067c7931c3fcd95","6e4b62f6ee1090e00f0dc4205cb412555e895acd","94e5fd9705487e82d5e757e95eaceab9488861de","77f5399e3a7a7f11a407d8d7ae777730d43a5fb7","35a3e7cbd023483b4535991de804aa171a2fb71e","51256edcdb4f794cd44b07019874c37c39df5229","6fd4ea1566e259030d9e5ecd341ac33743785bfa","169b6b0fffa99ed5115f970f61701ded2c7611b0","6df713aec8736d2843e5370d33ce265a9b2bc571","1525dbe4f44cbbc635fdd5f5f4c5aa20c96efef7","363fb257c5e3b656820317f62592ae1b328fb68a","8b16a9b1eb45ffb5bb8fa3cdd52c9e7d679d2cd0","5c7896628a87a36bdf83096c425d6efa8c88cfd8","50c34e4ca32220c5a7134e6b3c1971927d0a54a2","6789fe4a27eef636e944cafd819592f6a3ff8880","21a906870972675ccfc7f7c2a0eeb37d319a7152","5b7008622426b6100c344efff4a76832e7d47400","1ca957f0be5800b2f69c49de463fe56603d6218e","63801bdfedb3ccc6c64bc8310f762db945f0b931","6439e8d64543f7b3f9b02af3e521c5b6fb5e1583","9269601d66f80c4d289e4c39677ed365b7df9f68","a49a601e7998e1485581e91a8f881ac4c509fbf0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bell-labs.com/~votta/work/papers/icse16.ps","http://www.cs.umd.edu/~aporter/icse16.ps","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=257734.257749"],"title":"An Experiment to Assess Different Defect Detection Methods for Software Requirements Inspections","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

These projects have been started without sufficient previous training given to the developers. An increment in the productivity has been seen as the projects progress. This paper proposes a simulation model for software development which can deal with variances of developers’ productivity during software development. As the proposed model takes into account the developer’s learning curve, it can be used to compute a developer’s productivity and the quantity of gain to the developer’s knowledge in executing an activity. The proposed model has been applied to four typical scenarios in our case study. The results show that it is highly practicable. An outline of a project planning prototype which is based on the proposed model is presented. The prototype can be used to make project plans which take the developer’s learning curve into consideration.","inCitations":["a734b2ea75cb1a2e3601858137858b8250a23cd9","df0a7a8af5f686110c59c2e71e9575830fa118a7","2e177f064cae471cf21c7368b0f7e5cbe51fc22a","9f222c747762b8cdb048611009af955e5f69e267","298c32bf050911746af55c7b0b1224ffe8ddb30a","7c82889f759c777632b23f8ec3394abdfbcb95d8","d79ff97959de2c857eb24fef3df71d1154f3307e","c599e09091a22c756ac4a3ec14c184be2aaa30b6","6d580911fc3f09a0b7eafb01d9b752e45f517afb","60b759d45cd2035f09f415c73d64741caeb131c0","3d59981ac1d62cc6280b8805e72bdf5806e16c6e","95f65ffdeb5f39ac1cb0feb27302a68f08ea5a92","1cc558c7cd501a4331c1ee2a3b5e279c5a9c115d","5be726452ba803874dc999bbbeb74bd79c60149f","4e806a7a22aede0da412a32af97ae79c59309da9","a1747b0a5791a7def4debe7917bc8148b97b4660","4e80f3f01e975ff0474ea90bfdc477c479f4cdd5","4b3c13f4ac36ace7fd5df85feb6b24ec29953724","39a2592b92c21363fb6bea47bd019dac6549c183","ebb333138ba75560a0c0059a5bcd5ad36bb62461","18fa5f9762f64ed3d5b4873d0bc8eef298fc2b69","b1266659f8de3efc3507c6a970ffd6ccb212ff83","3bb8e86fc97a49f43af79e3f440332aca6622d0a","a023f6d6c383f4a3839036f07b1ea0aa04da9cbb","3e31f3e8a8e90d95729a88845139cf5f7484a820"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388"],"title":"A Learning Curve Based Simulation Model for Software Development","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.1998.671388","venue":"ICSE"}

A complexity metric, called DU, is defined for the control graph of a structured program. This new metric is different from other control-graph based metrics in that it is based on “representative” data flow information in a control graph. An algorithm for computing the value of DU(G) for a control graph G is given. The lower and upper bounds of DU(G) are provided. The DU metric is shown to have several advantages over other control-graph based complexity metrics.","inCitations":["2c2ef792c2c524cc76b9e2620e542433443218d9","145cb89e3f7a52b1df75d02f8b830c31b2fea8f0","aed72606d64f60164991e4e37799cc135efc17a8","090ee32efd8759801bf9681b3549431e06aa1c68","963888277904ba2e01e6e257b58aa58c39b344e0","67e7942a57b89c2d3d13da667956014ae4831729","33ba91b7dbe68e5a082f38e9ebf23a70ae5ae00a","3d8ef68e2b65cf2e6c6e3ecda3db5645cbd31bf4","aef930c488424d11ffaa643d8ded03d7f0373d3d","4c6e8a888e3d2cdd6ae97b5e59e1acb6072bc042","d8ae20f22aabb8d08cbabb939842f91aea04c967","c7571095c7d59ce0e1014b518dc5a45d64fa78bd","bd23c3f20bb5613b938bb9d5d1913167db7b1491","637f974b3a7166f25dfea053e977d9d328c763be","193b3a3e28ec80665065a331dbb3fd4c5cfefb7a","e3aae4823f42d987e1d934077b2d5cb8f3f58eb3","191128f6070278f4f1ed89943ef6885f71a6e4d5","2c6d971c3e638a43aa4a8f9567e908780491d9e8","22424e71407ab3ba66a61b3b03e91fa67161faa0","28fecea3023292b9c4d9c3a597dc988097727798","e16d1d161db4811b37fd856d3ab001503137beb3"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=801976"],"title":"A Program Complexity Metric Based on Data Flow Information in Control Graphs","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

The theory describes how component developers can design and test their components to produce measurements that are later used by system designers to calculate composite system reliability — without implementation and test of the system being designed. The theory describes how to make component measurements that are independent of operational profiles, and how to incorporate the overall system-level operational profile into the system reliability calculations. In principle, the theory resolves the central problem of assessing a component, which is: a component developer cannot know how the component will be used and so cannot certify it for an arbitrary use; but if the component buyer must certify each component before using it, component-based development loses much of its appeal. This dilemma is resolved if the component developer does the certification and provides the results in such a way that the component buyer can factor in the usage information later, without repeating the certification. Our theory addresses the basic technical problems inherent in certifying components to be released for later use in an arbitrary system.\nMost component research has been directed at functional specification of software components; our theory addresses the other, equally important, side of the coin: component quality.","inCitations":["073d8f38d483affbab631905e06ab7e2307e807f","c3d6b31e4ab88d156054104660c9d22f3b572419","17e3e2532c85cfa82819a1ec4b6fc630c0c2f4a8","a66f6ac1226dd787eddff719511fe814d22eb651","1f0774eb8ef13971a545dbdc406d7560a073bbc9","e97b6b863cb77c4b624f63f48b8a9690f12943a5","c011c58320d90155edc48d525ed33b316aa7358b","b43e3e0bd06913d26c0ca0044de4a21c0dae1e45","cdeb4d108bfe1529f33cbaba04638a637d3cd797","6f9fc90b208ed614901fb507f51d09b98bd3bec5","9fa73f416de151739cb47a0ea71f390bdd4e2792","b2a6dbb0f0257eb66b8c6c796a98141116eac79c","c3b655e86bfbbccf511eacc2951b729ca3c20932","8f1b52e03c654293e6e3b70808e33c422650e219","4b717ccd0aa1647a1a10eea221e7c56369b95dd2","9b7fc599cd90c2f8a4191df952468748a888c323","430b44723ec4e8ac653db8d843962aee4ccc9efe","76a5c9246aabe1c874316f206f58e16e4c02ca88","608b0676ac604453e4c9d9cdcdfbe2d86d9141a4","5cb8de47191be5b3cc64c90d2b4687e3dedf2e1c","fea1a0943c584d07626c6dc6a4614d27574eb2ab","7dcad42398cf998a8a27ea8bb1a160271bddcd6d","ab6d800f0aed1930519a263ff859b32296f8cef7","ee2c04fb9f9c2d0e1605f93489b0198e26b64af1","29bb343a4f6045ee2250372e29270faea63524d9","2034cf67c9d1863d7c53047d80b6ee2d6b5a571f","f1f231827cb4157178ceb4ef65b3ef9d7a9305fd","5def6f816b0cbb7c1b4d21a953c135b95d5c5896","d766df28b3b3dc000d700c4bee34b513ff9c03ea","414a1f2225fe64f0b846ed825ecd47032de5e13c","a4df1d27363af2ad73d67f992282bb281adc8442","aede417618b184697d4ef3a318000a1c496a2542","eeac147b507e02e765cb7c2682aa67cbe6f641f9","d574f77b38e083373992be6d732f5b18b4fd763b","3dea9d5f3a650d6caa05ce40a5f79e23c1e19180","a80f00121cca0fb0724e158b8e2e431c89df2396","a03fe3fe4e36c9afc99c2ff66896db39ad864250","5869c79c230e7d6c5cb7ae3ee743fac0e16f2b95","73590a5e642186bf54d4603de011c52ac2ffce86","d0ae4017412d2b93f1df6914ceffea2094aa851d","03917679596b9619f65f855d339b4402bf762df4","d3567378054b686f27b622d01173a5e12c327428","5cf6bb4819b20c9003771644df904de73eff268e","03ac081eacf80d2468757c412a3ac35016c4f964","ab8455cf457d5c4145137144f934b8af59d8fa56","5d854d599c096ac4d3e206d056b9bef7873283e8","9696192d3debc2005fa2c949db213d94a36351a8","dfff40d433901e8e81717ba1bf62fe27e634e620","c7702164cc62992c2b31650014fd238ae866ba68","00dd012d3cd7e415c03eb569c94a74201b063760","11254462c61e3fb98eb0fb6ae7f1dabad148b316","3bc9ae3afb1398ac4a68c4df6adfc234836c2cab","d6953f7104cae029eb309b8581242ba2e59022af","616dd9d1f33e6ce8485702d9f9825719bbd3d5b8","6f7d16a3ac5b6aaa01d39cc3a22bf548331e9173","fd6e5e11033700fb0b75715b99ea6b7cc7865586","da0afe1005f63cebca084e4526ff497da60b84e2","add8cb35dfaa1ad2e5ccc909a598a8e9c7a4bb18","ff3f77c45a8cfd844dfcbff41a6c13844b9bbfc6","e81eb19c4fce496a0108cc31b4f9b479a1ec4138","6ac5a0d9372616805a02498cdeec7a05b7b5be5b","799399affe74ab8cd9d06dbd953f81b9ef876c0a","e0242f16cf182f5aeb1cffff230578a8551da5ce","10357f796885991762046a1401f5abc53ab5fe4a","097b2b4625942bf7f441f18735a4c0d9ab50c1dd","b42afb789d32cfe5dcc0ef182cf528b9e56ccc91","8c74ec77b8f25563be717785b5fa16a2b4671292","5362ff1f8ef303c4f470a700d53a667a3dafb362","730e8eacb8bee94e3b2f11c5b8bec0b34d1a33d8","c98b198da701c21bea4907881361e2595d51858f","97299ed2585a3b4f95aed91d0b5b01085813908a","3654ded5636c73b27a5d6efb93bcc40c0f7d114c","72041bc681edea4c8502a067a598e7de370cca7d","d08bc1f632d90da6ae8c129eedd1328eaea50f84","7753ec8d742c049c027943ff20e4d0e4d0be8dc1","d4a9676686c7e50e524425340851baef72d33c82","c204d76f49993002b025377add3597f4e4ab4c23","c9710b54606938efce360e29d9bbd97bde3e0375","7925cc4d22c2120f9712ad5c3d2e865259c02980","bce231710d1fb2b601ef53dfdeeb3cfa98782f26","1ff30832a5ee49cf0ec04029fb374acaeb34549e","942807387b0d5f44715d9b669ba2713a59b42043","02ef2ffb1105928334877bb99bca7a9868f23757","0726208a36cd8983ad5774d9a2b528e286439326","041ea35574feb0ba125ed4bb26ba97b62f3d7fb5","39c5a25f6b3f550bc6bd4ab0c6765b5350cab143","d518d02e75536e9e8870905c4df59b381f9be6f0","13a959fa5f9ee8e62b9c724f32c144f8ed530d11","d7c402da2e86f119607c7d43fec0119fc58a43ee","027d6a6e43751c7eede2140ed57cd413b5effa2d","b83d8f55b0c41946c99c0828d04dfa6173e1ee79","0537bad016d8f2e09bcb40c01f83d12de4bc95b1","8745ca68fb0abf3c3d5bcf6111cdc58f3b65119a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.ps.Z","http://www.deeds.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/events/meetings/05/Hamlet_TheorySWReliabilityComponents_icse.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.pdf","http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~hamlet/icse01.pdf"],"title":"Theory of Software Reliability Based on Components","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2001.919109","venue":"ICSE"}

It provides an alternative scenario-centric approach to architecture development. The combination of scenarios and Unified Modeling Language (UML) semantics is referred to as the Naval Architecture Environment (NAE). Specifically, it recommended the acquisition of Rational Rose. The NAE combines the best practices of software development with the domain-specific insight contained in the Framework to create an efficient process, supported by a commercial tool and robust semantics, to allow the analysis and design of interoperable C4ISR systems. These are systems that will support Joint Vision 2010's call for Information Superiority. Tools have been developed which allow tactical data to be exchanged over Internet Protocol networks, but the quality of service necessary to operate these tools is not available for most Naval vessels at this time. The objective of this thesis is to show that using Multicast IP, distributing data in layers using an efficient protocol, and sending data with no inherent mechanism to ensure that packets arrive at their destinations will allow data to be exchanged over IP networks at much lower bandwidths than is required today while still maintaining a common tactical picture. Software was developed which interfaces to GCCS-M and exchanges data over a multicast network. This software was tested in a laboratory which simulated a Naval environment. The results of testing demonstrate the potential of using the characteristics of the track data being exchanged in a true multicast architecture to develop a efficient tactical data distribution system for users operating in the Naval environment.","inCitations":["dc46d71e9817f0d5f8467dfef83bc0dbd507e9b6","0c9e6ff678c31387fe243a808f1cba8beb89e9ad","5f5ab0f0f69231c31a287eb9dde93299721937f7","95a8a21ef5b33692348f771b7f8e07617d573962","e43806026988327b7b2dbb7f67eee4fb3d6be0cd","700e0a5776480847591b370ec2c08889862cb768","45fff80ba582bbc1d12c1aa5d23e1f1dbdbb9b79","d06b951c0ae7adaf5f9ca7740c8e071a917555fd"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802960"],"title":"Software Engineering: Management, Personnel and Methodology","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICSE"}

But the focus of attention has shifted in recent years. Early work emphasizing the study of languages for defining processes was rapidly eclipsed by process evaluation and improvement work, most notably the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). As process improvement has matured as a strategy and philosophy it has also given rise to a strong reaction to the perception that it is unduly ponderous and constraining. Movements such as Extreme Programming (XP) have cast themselves as lightweight alternatives, emphasizing the primacy of freedom and flexibility. Both philosophies and communities continue to grow in size, development, and depth of understanding.The goal of this panel will be to explore the differences between these major approaches to the use of process in software development by bringing together leading articulate exponents of the approaches. Each panelist will be charged with presenting a very concise characterization of the approach being represented. But the focus of the panel will be on understanding the nature of the differences in approach, and the reasons for these differences. Similarities will be sought as well.An underlying hypothesis of the panel is that the differences in approach arise in large measure from differences in objective and differences in assumptions about the software development context. Thus, for example, one approach may be intended to support very long range organizational objectives, while the other may be more tactically oriented. One approach may assume that evolvability is an overriding objective, while another may be more focused on speed to market. One may make stronger assumptions about the skills and training of project personnel. The panel will attempt to delve into these issues to see if it may be possible to suggest criteria for suggesting which approach (and possible adaptation) should be selected for a given development situation.In a larger sense, the goal of this panel is to suggest the possibility of a discipline of software process engineering. Insofar as the panel is able to suggest that development situations can be used to guide the selection of process approaches to the provision of assistance, might this then be an indication that process formalisms could play a role in subsequent specification of detailed processes, and evaluation of their effectiveness?The panel will react to this and related questions. While lively interchanges among the panelists will be stimulated and expected, similar interchanges with the audience will also be cultivated.","inCitations":["f4656515bf31d18fd0a7c7ac3d1270ec85c592fc"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581426"],"title":"Lightweight vs. heavyweight processes: is this even the right question?","doi":"10.1145/581339.581426","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581426","venue":"ICSE"}

Action Language forms an interface between transition system models that a model checker generates and high level specification languages such as Statecharts, RSML and SCR—similar to an assembly language between a microprocessor and a programming language. We show that Action Language translations of Statecharts and SCR specifications are compact and they preserve the structure of the original specification. Action Language allows specification of both synchronous and asynchronous systems. It also supports modular specifications to enable compositional model checking.","inCitations":["c125bda6fb804330c0f19ac876e031a847ed040d","4e10c848cb7ed3cd8f3bafeefb1720833d58c80e","45aafc86141267ceab0e824d80762acd7b805d47","39d8c3b607976148df4a25eb96316cd610abea05","a1156609916f52e7a7b4150461f172188de796ae","35bcf2486fc32d9a5b8e912d448338387571a2ed","0a65d8353267046dfaf2a61400062b009708e7bc","4552673b6a06264f6de3c83bb826b66909f8656a","1ea6653d892ce2c4bc35567ec07be558e45eac01","d94e2fc9476f079963b00499b4d42aa820639dbb","594d7fcf8e81f28b53f08349cfa88a875814fc8d","428f7f329858051296cdd38d13be5c2e337a3937","fb2b0d744138fe0d5a5b0f589ab915ac41f6c404","c87ee2d4580a50361fe7aae3da8c2a9104973dac","4a544a85c314781b874a578022fd87424cc87e4a","63d3058fc8c72536ff82de61765dd76a6998a9cc","3f2903614d337af29e96dba5aa555164b39a9918","26d34d204095549bd45e7e1cb5a29942e78904f4","03c465c75de13b66369f1500996e364a88c2181d","0a29839a46d8ffc084d7e764c6d106295f2d1674","425ac2503689a9a82182613782b2ab886554b672","4a27d940c578da238eda3ef393ed8a3aa9a9e9c7","09105f031a7193f8f3f4276e9ae6aa08f0bc635d","7e0115601d9961b4349343cca540b01cd2ce3aa7","258a8c6710a9b0c2dc3818333ec035730062b1a5","c624efe61bbb965e4f54d3114e728db39d7d9cb5","0c34620bfdd0869d1d4fc9a342e89a8d74e53749","d27d7440b7d9d276c65c885dd2bdfc85a9627cc3","0d2773b8cf4d5a6ca5bb05d0373989111ec00d83","2e5eed5d714e944cec6210df58e6ce0d6100cf89"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337219","http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~bultan/publications/icse00.ps"],"title":"Action Language: a specification language for model checking reactive systems","doi":"10.1145/337180.337219","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337219","venue":"ICSE"}

So, these data or models are only helpful when they match the WC context well. When they do not, a fair amount of WC training data, which are usually expensive to acquire, are still necessary to achieve good performance. We investigate how to make best use of CC data, so that we can reduce the amount of WC data while maintaining or improving performance in comparison to WC SEE models. This is done by proposing a new framework to learn the relationship between CC and WC projects explicitly, allowing CC models to be mapped to the WC context. Such mapped models can be useful even when the CC models themselves do not match the WC context directly. Our study shows that a new approach instantiating this framework is able not only to use substantially less WC data than a corresponding WC model, but also to achieve similar/better performance. This approach can also be used to provide insight into the behaviour of a company in comparison to others.","inCitations":["0457771cccdac72e8b5bf52bc2ef03ff3197393e","f99b6ee01fa8b363e3b032574eb6bdea2c0164ab","f641c4ef600897420f455953bea35f37556e4ba4","b78622789d01c4c9a951605164decb30c6ac1507","38cc302b9204c222316a2ed34813f16d42e5c7b4","a0330203b9292498aefc7b6cf11378a964c91fde","216932333a3cee5456ca50b29b06edbad1d0409f","de41592c20b21afb76517d3e2ef99b66beae5536","6b844e8d01bc4da829d5b239bcc3d2820cc01339","4ab760d05de6a761574296ce4fbba4c575ae13db","7b3442b107da32174e9d9e5dcd9b826709df39c0","c6f9192c2a3cc3fc68f758aa4edb5fcfc61d426a","4c316967cd8a59f07aa869e3f25b49e99c02c8d1","415a4e665b4316f5cf0a8c9290b9cf71efa64b69","48a81cc7fc0cf288f12feea04111e0207046e2ff","301e5fe8ce4cc82f58ada3b5d5b2c36195cfb959","383734ad2f97c14502210ebdefa5b4638bd1f826","3582918462f3e4a363c9fc431a61e28d470fd680","57594d304f41006116bbc0e311495be6614919bc","1c5fb3c531786008de7e7783b6b78245cc61ea41","e0f644531fa46cb08d65db11a5b27a552c5763c7","55346fc5380e70bc6efd9cecedb842c92eb180be","441d7d7d61a04177446ab13eefd1b733c49a1aa1","178a226a4fa68d80f709d0cfff5f5458df0daad3","7f9d8661ade486e6ccfbbf572097a101973225ca"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568228","http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~minkull/publications/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/llm11/publications/slidesMinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~minkull/publications/slidesMinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/14899606/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf","http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/llm11/publications/MinkuYaoICSE14.pdf"],"title":"How to make best use of cross-company data in software effort estimation?","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568228","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568228","venue":"ICSE"}

Campo","ids":["1710506"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Aspect-oriented technologies are increasingly promoting new ways of developing software in order to better control change and improve software adaptability and evolution. Current aspect technologies make now available novel means to achieve the principle of separation of concerns. However, aspect-oriented development still appears strongly attached to the underlying programming approach used to support it, rather than to design mechanisms guiding development. Supporting aspects at the design phase can greatly improve aspect-oriented development, because aspects can be identified and incorporated earlier in the development process. Therefore, tools or CASE environments assisting developers to bridge the gap between aspect-based design specifications and these AOP technologies are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, we propose an approach for enhancing aspectoriented software development considering aspects as first-class design entities. The proposal puts together lines of research coming from different fields, namely: aspect-oriented frameworks, aspect models extending UML models, knowledge-driven framework documentation and agent-based planning. The concept of smart-weaving promotes essentially an early incorporation of aspects in the development cycle, so that designers would be able to specify their designs by means of aspect models, reuse parts of these models, and also provide different strategies to map generic aspect structures to specific implementations. With this purpose, we have built an experimental environment called Smartweaver aiming to support this process. The kind of assistance provided by the tool relies on the Smartbooks method, a method extending traditional techniques for framework documentation. Smartbooks is based on agent technology, more precisely, it includes a special planning agent that is able to derive the sequence of activities that should be executed to implement a given functionality from a target framework. In order to do so, framework designers need to supply some information to the agent in advance.

Copyright 2002 ACM 1-58113-472-X/02/0005...$5.00. is described through a predefined format of rules that we call the Smartbooks documentation method. The method prescribes that the framework designer should describe the fimctionality provided by the framework, how this functionality is implemented by different framework components, and provide rules to somehow constraint the ways the framework can be specialized. In particular, this method was applied to the case of aspect-oriented frameworks. The Smartweaver tool takes advantage of these ideas and provides an UML-based environment where developers can define both classes, aspects and crosscutting relationships among them. All this graphical information is collected by a special tool, which is also provided with adequate knowledge about how to map generic aspectual specifications into a given AOP implementation support. In our case study, we used the AspectModerator Framework (AMF). Then, the Smartweaver engine is able to combine this domain knowledge to derive an instantiation plan to implement the desired aspectual behavior. Very briefly, in order to apply smart guidance on an given application it is necessary to accomplish the following activities: build a smartbook of support technology, design the target application, then add smart-weaving documentation, and finally put all these things together. The visual formalism developed to specify aspect models, as an extension of conventional UML diagrams, intends to be independent of particular AOP implementation technologies. This favors communication among aspect developers, promoting a common documentation model for aspect-based applications. In later design stages, developers are free to decide which rules will map these models into a given AOP technology. From this perspective, it would be possible to have a general-purpose tool, and add such aspect technologies as plug-in packages. These packages would define a corpus of Smartbooks-based knowledge to map aspect models into particular AOP technologies. At this moment, a basic UML-compliant CASE environment integrated with the Smartweaver engine has been developed. This prototype currently supports a part of the features provided by commercial tools such as Rational Rose or Together, however, we are planning to improve these capabilities in the future. Regarding the Smartweaver engine, it still presents some limitations. Not all the instantiation actions can be derived if there is not enough knowledge available. For these reasons, we have started to explore the possibilities of increasing the agent's reasoning capabilities with more advanced reasoning techniques, as casebased reasoning and bayesian networks.","inCitations":["c92230444e4d9feea079000147dfde3a47e79233","cd1bfbaf7ab66be25f02b15cc72ae5c784a35d85"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581467"],"title":"Smartweaver: an agent-based approach for aspect-oriented development","doi":"10.1145/581339.581467","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/581339.581467","venue":"ICSE"}

Fifteen projects using a COTS-based approach were studied and their actual process was documented. This process is evaluated to identify essential differences in comparison to traditional software development. The main differences, and the activities for which projects require more guidance, are requirements definition and COTS selection, high level design, integration and testing.\nStarting from these empirical observations, a new process and guidelines for COTS-based development are developed and briefly presented. The new process is currently under experimentation.","inCitations":["61884e9665ca96a1b92103a954722c933bfd44e9","163bc02d13dd125f67fcca91debdfb585801b252","028944e596bbe7fa553bb87286514e0efa1e78fd","81885c59570909b2eed7e0f8adb50f30d4047311","5e155b5ce79d7ac8de602f59d1ff4052bb734081","4236d279ca7265e61dfd3c07e6942688c725386a","f0d90607806643b2b2913d012d36692be51d2fea","57c8ca8c1ead02e63f709c9e4d97581608c52732","63b4896cb051a3f346492f0c42c121052f4af649","46b8e73718d0f20123f94330bd27a052edb19301","027d71ff9f579336f0cf54591fb35bff72bf1c52","ea4c0ab8eb3a5f88a314c1884654c5d767ccbd3b","d23165b35c2f696d8245e2b432aa912a72c78331","edea818baba0d37250085a5fd772017f86e7f6ae","90cc1d5dea24d1475a29b2955df3cb71902702b6","dc39e5db5f0cfbe833f1e1a4cbe7f30ffb3f5140","16d67241624f3bbf7bdff5a9b3bf160fa41d2962","8f6a7b85806fcd50b605ef2c2a412c8ac1ee618c","d04f8cc9ba743166482d815ff71e236cb4f46577","4dd993846378c5ae50a6eeeec223b6a11974bf04","668f340e8e501cd7f2eb35188a3af46f7ed9c765","380bddec5b598ecc6188208ed0b3c662d34ca50a","4ea6d09d69309e2dabe4e62294009bbc2445f812","0dea41c60cc14828134f9af0bd2f9ee3f1677850","b2316a59212610d47af9b88aa62fb25ab2d58de9","692f8393409177baeb04a5e226d9beeab096346e","4296c418385f7aca5414645abf0bfe84358125f5","0fd3077e56f2725f74cf9670a5d1b3f18ee7a38f","aa6da71c3099cd394b9af663cfadce1ef77cb37b","95ea8463ff9bc7f75d41fe36deb2cc30236246b8","90ba553f798f6c66f38bfe7539e17562c8aa560d","f1ffd15696702383b595b4d522b2a3797b33809e","51f1db2e85660d6d4f121422147893cf7aa638a7","8186c2da99cfcbcbf6b4c6a202dc4cddb3ba979f","533367299ef177e7471205b4af62654cb75f478a","0f1c22eb239f6494cac2db71d304d893ebd87fcb","ad80185a46b7b19a78d7243f00c07b76cd83f23b","eea9dd75261ddd7a0f047d0fe9d8749d769b6ce3","519fe1fd5ea17df71dc4b6427a3fe63043a95cf2","e390150559dc53be89bd34dd81d64572b149438c","151b97a8ab9b985ceb6127598447a8e0699a68e8","29d7f4c64184fae44172cef2c6e79abfd4be329b","3be98c1a641f9f62ca20826771dffe44cc4efab7","d0c0cabd169b164f0827d15bc294ad4a9f53dbbe","d0dacda2ee8307649ba31ed667251963b29c7284","82841e39ba95e4c1bf2f03d3613e4116663e1dfb","385d0403f7fabe27205842544c0410d88aa394fa","a1acbb487310f6270d0f6c3d6154fbc1f35cabd6","acdede88f2827a8aad5945538b30ad643170a6e8","28655fb756e0c67768ef0bb49ecb224ac7ec4d64","04da14b5f65ee75d9278e7bac33c5258eae3952f","231dd24b26722ec4ff80cbc8fea54388891bc389","263634b7f9dc119700a37ba79e78cfe10eb159b6","8e2d2238b94663fceee90e6c88aa03fd2f780c1c","7ef25fb68af6a37fc47fd8f236473354b5be0455","9470b438e6cd69fef8a8f5c2c24f92cf75946151","7ee9cb64e38ecf6a22e3bb2579268c05e4cd5045","2e695bb3ffc0486277e2e6182ff71fa9cb55e4cb","e2c6f7a4fb1db7613af71c2b00612ce552808d80","6e48e91978165d4d25e1f523056a8965339f3a3b","f5218512f7bedd470f0c936f5e813219df9252f6","e8e19cd41e6f8ee27b553b3fc938678b444eeaf4","957505ad83ef0b7f84845637cf0411e070d37410","4c4f6eacdf34faa9864d14875055913621e58894","e05af70aa326c6ad18db57a347fcaeeea98e5638","0044f7cd922dcf363c42029ecd27c13adb0baaf4","8f32a8b2f5a709a09f7cfc9e7a9e131cf07603b5","e4e03b1e83d209fe257a1a8dde95b266a40ef6a0","d8e05f1cf944b8db93bde3613d78d0712f240e27","dd38a94b875966077789cacbe9ae2a1c4fb0a5ae","f777a14a4fa27bc5d480661f0b7e3a9d1ff1d433","808aedcd087271bff0eb1757d24a9653cf5392dc","93b1cc9ecefb27783d4a0ecb90e3aa80b34b65da","c9e1af1362b266737e9d1bd42a5e1f6c7ffab0d4","0cf2e8e1862aa0310aaa9e2ce688c50c046337db","7ceaf17104f012f77cd48422989b378bdb022a90","878c4bf7649bd20a44e60707051f7a681a9a1e68","f2c676107f98df5d31923e2fca1e6d031265d677","5af309347a450b3e1319cab3b6512b42d77457f7","4ead826c66c2657a59f10718e4883961a32dc7ca","89624d086f1f761e8f974e41b09baae81b5a1b60","31a2106301f5fdb19f99a8d9be8516c2e26e0193","92d03b6fbe25bee56fdfb69a2296384cbbe5e9db","f2a5a2547cf81c0b727868092678929be00d4ee4","8d920dffe0643c5f4d8a562e89e40f6daf22275e","69c41bb31f39c4ec11e9931f0decc28800e320b7","7917467dc3341d9eafba03bae1f90b8843ba58c7","884ca69b44277effec184abb4daf3159f62bd9e2","8668d0ec289618406fab696db28fd412b2836a6f","707983553e9b9488d137322c9bf695749383d911","bedfa438ba932b0091a5275242962e23040c147d","962553735fd7f8036b59a8996baf3c436fa156ce","c5b9d4569dadb7c4a0f9ef9d9e67ae6b1006aa87"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/papers/83.83.pdf","http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/courses/dif8901/papers2003/P-r08-morisio00.pdf","https://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337186","http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf","http://www.cs.umd.edu/~basili/publications/proceedings/P89.pdf"],"title":"Investigating and improving a COTS-based software development","doi":"10.1145/337180.337186","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337186","venue":"ICSE"}

Therefore, in complicated engineering processes, engineers with different areas of expertise often find it difficult to access the same information in different domain-specific modeling environments. \n Our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the models as task-oriented spreadsheets, using a unified model (in UML or SysML) and a unified user interface (in the spreadsheet program). The formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks while the target models remain in a unified modeling language. Since the transformation between the spreadsheets and the models is automated and transparent, users do not have to be skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets. \n Using our novel approach, we were able to reduce the errors and time, and also the difficulty for each task without providing specialized training for the engineers. A preliminary user study showed that, by applying the spreadsheet-based approach, we could reduce the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering tasks.","inCitations":["36c1e5aa3aea47750b986e710b1a6be3682d7ae0","294125450397136c5daf03461e2bb3755d1d8009"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568231","http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/jp-E35063/main.pdf"],"title":"Controlled modeling environment using flexibly-formatted spreadsheets","doi":"10.1145/2568225.2568231","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2568225.2568231","venue":"ICSE"}
